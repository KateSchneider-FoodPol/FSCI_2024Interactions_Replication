The Heart Sign Meal is a menu labelling scheme for healthy restaurant food. This scheme makes it easier for the diner to assemble a healthy meal and for the food maker to prepare healthy food. The subscriber of the food service, on the other hand, can use the Heart Sign to determine the best possible offer for its diners in the invitation to tender. The use of the heart badge in restaurants began in 2008.&nbsp;A heart sign is a sign found on food packaging and in restaurants that indicates that the product or food portion in question is a better option for health. The heart badge has been developed to make everyday life easier and faster. By choosing Heart Label products, you make small, health-friendly changes to your diet without having to read product descriptions or nutritional content.

A heart symbol system was introduced in 2000 by the Finnish Heart Foundation and the Finnish Diabetes Foundation. The heart symbol indicates that a product is a better choice regarding sodium and salt content compared with another product in the same food category. The heart symbol system is acknowledged by the Finnish national authorities, and the National Nutrition Council recommends consumers to use products bearing the heart symbol.

If the salt content exceeds the permitted salt content limit for certain foods important for salt intake, it must be indicated on the packaging by the words “high salt” or “high in salt”. The labelling of high salinity is determined by the amount of total salt in the food (both added and natural). The amount of sodium is converted to salt by multiplying it by 2.5 (for example, 400 mg of sodium = 1000 mg, ie 1 g of salt)

On 26 January 2016, the French Ministry of Health introduced Article 5 of the Health Act that recommended introducing a system of nutrition labelling. The Directorate-General for Health requested Public Health France to design the nutrition labelling and the decision to recommend the NutriScore system was informed by research that trialled four different types of nutrition labels in 80 supermarkets in September 2016. The NutriScore system was chosen as the most consumer-friendly. The NutriScore label uses a nutrient-profiling system, based on the UK Food Standards Agency model. It classifies food and drinks according to five categories of nutritional quality, indicated via a colour scale ranging from dark green to dark red. Each colour is also associated with a letter from A (dark green) to E (dark red) to make the labelling more accessible and understandable to consumers. The score takes into account for every 100 grams of produce whether the contents of the product include nutrients and food that should be favoured (positive nutrients including fibre, protein, fruit and vegetables) or nutrients that should be limited (negative nutrients including energy, saturated fatty acids, sugars, salt). The amount of nutrients per 100 grams contained in the product is scored using a points system (0–40 for negative nutrients and 0–15 for positive nutrients that should be favoured). The nutritional score of the product is calculated by subtracting the negative nutrient points from the positive nutrient points. All processed food is included, except aromatic herbs, teas, coffees and yeasts, and all beverages, except alcoholic beverages. The European Commission approved the use of the NutriScore label and on 31 October 2017 the French government signed a decree outlining that the NutriScore label would be used in France. The label is voluntary. The fourth National Health Nutrition Program plans to extend the use of the Nutri-Score to out-of-home catering and unpacked foods in the future.""

It is a joint Australian, state and territory governments and New Zealand government initiative developed in collaboration with industry, public health and consumer groups. The HSR system takes into account four aspects of a food associated with increasing risk for chronic diseases; energy, saturated fat, sodium and total sugars content along with certain ""positive"" aspects of a food such as its content of fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and, in some instances, dietary fibre and protein. Star ratings range from ½ star (least healthy) to 5 stars (most healthy). Implementation is overseen by the Food Ministers' Meeting, the Food Regulation Standing Committee and the Health Star Rating Advisory Committee. The HSR system was independently reviewed in 2019, with an updated system implemented from 15 November 2020.

All food and beverages that exceed&nbsp;these limits are required to have a front-of-package black and white warning message inside a stop sign that reads “HIGH IN” followed by CALORIES, SATURATED FAT, CALORIES,&nbsp;SUGAR or&nbsp;SODIUM, as well as “Ministry of Health”. A warning message will be added to products per category that exceeds the limit (eg&nbsp;a product high in fat and sugar will have two stop signs). The regulatory norms provide specifications for the size, font&nbsp;and placement of the warning message on products. The limits for calories, saturated fat, sugar and sodium will be implemented using an incremental approach, reaching the defined limits by 1 July 2018 (see ""O – Offer healthy food and set standards in public institutions and other specific settings"" and “R – Restrict food advertising and other forms of commercial promotion” for details of the law's school food and advertising restrictions).

The Danish Whole Grain logo was launched in January 2009. It was developed by the Danish Whole Grain Partnership, which is comprised of the Danish Food Administration and Health NGOs (the Danish Cancer Society, the Danish Heart Foundation and the Danish Diabetes Association) and commercial partners (millers, bread, rice, pasta producers, retailers, craft bakeries and cereal producers). The Partnership aims to increase the availability of whole grain products and enhance knowledge of the positive effects of whole grain. Products must meet nutritional criteria set by a working group of the Partnership chaired by the Danish Food Administration that includes representatives from all types of partner organisations. In addition, products bearing the Whole Grain logo must also fulfill the Nordic Keyhole’s nutrient profile to ensure the logo does not appear on products high in fat, sugar and/or salt. It is mandatory for products bearing the Whole Grain logo to include this statement: “The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration recommends 75g whole grain per day as part of a varied diet” and “This product contains XXg whole grain per 100g”. A logo manual covers all aspects of use and promotion of the Whole Grain logo.

In El Salvador, producers and retailers are required by law to provide a list of the nutrient content of pre-packaged food products (with limited exceptions), even in the absence of a nutrition or health claim. The rules define which nutrients must be listed and on what basis (eg per 100g/per serving). Most other countries follow Guideline CAC/GL 2-1985 from the Codex Alimentarius Commission in requiring nutrition labels only when a nutrition or health claim is made and/or on food with special dietary uses.

National legislation regarding the compulsory use of warning labels on high-salt food in Finland has been in place since 1993. The legislation is applied to all the food categories that make a substantial contribution to the salt intake of the Finnish population.

Food that is high in salt is required to carry a ""high salt content"" warning if the salt content is more than 1.1% in bread, 2% in sausages, 2.2% in cold meat cuts, 2% in fish products, 1.4% in cheese, 1.2% in ready to eat meals,&nbsp;and 1.4% in breakfast cereals or crisp bread. These limits were last updated in December 2016 and since then also apply to unpackaged cheese, sausages, and other meat products, where the information must be communicated in writing at the retail outlet in a readily accessible&nbsp;manner close to the unpacked food.

In March 2015, the Iranian government introduced a new version of the Food and Beverages labelling regulation that introduced a front of pack traffic light label. It displays individual information on the fat, sugar, salt, trans fatty acids and energy content of the product to improve consumer understanding. Green indicates low or a little amount of the corresponding nutritional risk factor, yellow indicates a moderate amount and red shows a high amount, with thresholds set for each colour. For example, the thresholds for salt quantity are green - less than 0.3g of salt&nbsp;per 100g of food, yellow - between 0.3g and 1.5g of salt per 100g of food, and red - more than 1g of salt&nbsp;per 100g of food. The label is mandatory for all industrial foods which are manufactured in, or imported into, Iran. The label is not mandatory for traditional foods and outlet foods. This advanced labelling protocol was implemented step by step over a period of 18 months, extended for another 12 months, and is now fully implemented.

Depending on their composition, foods and drinks can carry one, two, or three warning labels carrying these messages: high levels of sugar, high levels of salt, and/or high levels of saturated fat.&nbsp;Food and drinks manufacturers have been granted two deadlines by which to reformulate their products: 1 January 2020 and 1 January 2021. In the first stage, the following thresholds were set: 500mg of sodium, 13.5g of total sugars, and 5g of total saturated fats per 100g of solid food. Beyond these limits, solid foods will require a red label. For drinks (‘liquid food') these maximum limits are 400mg of sodium, 5g of total sugars, and 3g for total saturated fat per 100 ml. Starting with January 2021, both these sets of limits will be reduced, as follows: 400mg of sodium, 10g of total sugars, and 4g of total saturated fat for solid food; and 300mg of sodium, 5g of total sugars, and 3g of total saturated fat acid for drinks.

They&nbsp;require&nbsp;the inclusion of a warning stamp that products are in ‘Excess’ of energy, sugars, saturated fat, trans fat and sodium.&nbsp;For phase I of implementation (Oct 2020 – Sept 2023), the Ministry of Health set the following nutrient limits: energy ≥ 275 kcal for solid foods,&nbsp;and for liquids&nbsp;≥ 70 kcal in total or ≥ 10 kcal due to free sugars; sugar ≥ 10 % of energy from free sugars (but drinks with &lt;10kcal of free sugars are excepted from stamps; saturated fat ≥10% of total energy; trans fat ≥1% of total energy; sodium ≥ 350 mg or ≥ 45 mg in no calorie drinks. For phase II of implementation (October 2023 – Sept 2025), the limit for calories from free sugar decreases to ≥ 8 kcal, while sodium limits become ≥ 1 mg per kcal or ≥ 300 mg and ≥ 45 mg in no calorie drinks. The FOPL seals indicate excess, and have to be accompanied by warning messages that they are harmful to children if they contain any amount of added caffeine or non-sugar sweeteners, under the following format: ‘Contains sweeteners – not recommended for children’ and ‘Contains caffeine avoid giving to children’.

The measures related to mandatory nutritional labelling and advertising restrictions on pre-packaged foods and non-alcoholic beverages are expected to enter into foce on April 1, 2021, when companies will cease to be allowed to place stickers of&nbsp;the new labels and all products will need to include all three&nbsp;requirements in the design of their packages.&nbsp;

The HSR system takes into account four aspects of a food associated with increasing risk for chronic diseases; energy, saturated fat, sodium and total sugars content along with certain ""positive"" aspects of a food such as its content of fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and, in some instances, dietary fibre and protein. Star ratings range from ½ star (least healthy) to 5 stars (most healthy). Implementation is overseen by the Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation, the Front-of-Pack Labelling Steering Committee, the Trans-Tasman Health Star Rating Advisory Committee, the New Zealand Health Star Rating Advisory Group and a Technical Advisory Group.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Keyhole symbol has been used as a common Nordic labelling scheme on food products in Norway, Denmark and Sweden since 2009. Which food product groups that can be labelled with the Keyhole symbol and the criteria the products must meet, are determined by Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Icelandic authorities. Use of the logo is voluntary, but products must conform to the nutrition criteria, which are identical among participant countries of the programme. The aim of the Keyhole logo is to help consumers choose products that contain less fat, salt and sugar. The purpose of the scheme is also to stimulate the food industry to develop more products with less fat, healthier fatty acid composition, less salt and sugar as well as with more dietary fiber, whole grains, vegetables and fruits.

In Norway, the Directorate of Health and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority are responsible for the labelling scheme. Using the Keyhole symbol is voluntary, and it is the manufacturers’ responsibility to follow the set of criteria set by the authorities. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is responsible for monitoring compliance with the regulations regarding use of the label. New, stricter requirements came into force on 1 March 2015, with a transition period until 1 September 2016 for products adhering to the old requirements. Under the new requirements, Keyhole products will need to contain less salt, sugar and saturated fat, and more whole grains. For the first time, criteria were introduced for maximum salt content in meat and fish products. Foods marked with the Keyhole contain more fiber and whole grains and less fat and saturated fat, sugar and salt, compared to other foods of the same type without the Keyhole. Some foods also contain more vegetables, fruits and berries.

The keyhole can be found on the packaging of the foods. You can also find the label on bread, meat and cheese that is not wrapped. All fresh fish, fruits, berries, vegetables and potatoes are keyhole products, even though they are not labeled with the Keyhole.

In August 2016, the voluntary Healthier Choices logo was launched in Thailand, a front-of-pack&nbsp;labelling scheme to help consumers identify healthier food choices (Notification of the Ministry of Public Health No. 373, B.E.2559 2016, Re: The Display of Nutrition Symbol on Food Label, 12 February 2016). The logo was developed in collaboration between the National Food Commission, the Ministry of Health's Food and Drug Administration, the Health Promotion Foundation and Mahidol University. The Healthier Choices logo is owned by the Thai Food and Drug Administration, and its use is managed by the Nutrition Promotion Foundation of Mahidol University. The logo can be applied to beverages, sauces and condiments, dairy products, ready-to-eat meals, instant food and snacks; it is intended to eventually cover all food products. To be eligible for the logo, fish sauce must&nbsp;not contain more than 6g of sodium per 100ml, and soy sauce not more than 5g sodium per 100ml. Beverages must&nbsp;not contain more than 6g of sugar per 100ml if they are sold in single-serving containers; in beverages sold in containers that exceed 150% of a single serving, sugar must not exceed 18g per container. All other food&nbsp;must not exceed 500kcal and has&nbsp;to reach at least 20 points out of an achievable 40 points on the required nutrient content. The point system contains minimum and maximum levels of total fat, saturated fat, total sugar, protein, sodium, calcium fibre and iron in six categories, ranging from 0 (worst) to 5 (best).

In 2015, the Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD) introduced the voluntary Weqaya food programme which allows food producers to use the Weqaya logo on products which satisfy the criteria set out in the Specification for using the Weqaya food programme (ADS 13/2015). The logo consists of a heart shape in which the word ‘Weqaya’ is written, meaning ‘prevention’ in Arabic. The specifications require that products must adhere to maximum levels of calories, total fat, saturated and trans fat, sodium, added, total and naturally occurring sugars, and cholesterol. In addition, they may not be deep fried or contain artificial sweeteners and flavours.&nbsp;Flour, rice and grain-based products must contain minimum amounts of whole grains and fibre to be permitted to bear the logo. The only beverages allowed under the programme are unsweetened 100% vegetable juices, and unsweetened low fat milk and other fermented dairy products.

EU Regulation No. 1169/2011 allows voluntary repetition on pre-packed food labels of those elements of the mandatory nutrition declaration that are of key importance for public health. Colour coding is an additional form of expression. &nbsp;In 2013, UK Ministers recommended the ‘multiple traffic light’. This label uses a colour coded system to provide simplified ‘at a glance’ information to help consumers determine if the prepacked food they are considering purchasing is high (red), medium (amber) or low (green) in fat, saturated fat, sugars and salt. If providing front of pack nutrition labelling, energy must be declared as kJ/kcal per 100g/mL as a minimum.

Front of pack nutrition labels, or labels that use interpretational aids such as colours and symbols can support healthy choices and may reduce obesity rates by communicating complex nutritional information to shoppers in a way that is easy to understand. This in turn may reduce dietary intakes of calories and nutrients, such as salt, saturated fat and sugar which, if overconsumed, have been linked to chronic disease and may also help consumers to control their calorie intake.
In 2012, following significant research on labelling schemes, the UK Government and Devolved Administrations consulted on how greater consistency and clarity on FOPNL might be achieved. In 2013 UK Health Ministers recommended the voluntary multiple traffic light label, a colour-coded system which shows at a glance whether a product is high (red) medium (amber) or low (green) in fat, saturated fat, salt and sugars, including the total energy (kilocalories and kilojoules) it provides.
Between 30 July – 21 October 2020 the UK Government held a four-nation evidence-gathering consultation on our front of pack nutrition labelling scheme to consider whether improvements were needed. &nbsp;
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This invited views and evidence on the &nbsp;
o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Current multiple traffic light scheme&nbsp;
o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New international examples&nbsp;
o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether FOPNL should reflect latest dietary advice&nbsp;
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alongside the consultation we commissioned the Obesity Policy Research Unit to test which FOPNL options support people to make healthier choices. &nbsp;

In 2010, the Nutrition Section of the Ministry of Health of Bahrain&nbsp;developed voluntary menu labelling recommendations for fast food chain restaurants. Nutrients are mostly displayed per portion and include calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates, salt and sugar. Menu labelling may be done in a variety of ways such as on panels at ordering counters and checkouts or on food tray sheets. The main fast food chains operating in Bahrain have implemented the menu labelling recommendations (such as Burger King, McDonald’s, Diary Queen, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway and Jasmi’s).

Regulated food service premises include&nbsp;restaurants, quick-service restaurants, convenience stores, grocery stores, movie theatres, public-facing cafeterias, food trucks and others. “Standard food items” are restaurant-type food or drink items (eg ready-to-eat items) that are sold or offered for sale in servings that are standardised for portion and content. Menus include paper menus, menu boards, electronic menus, drive-through menus, online menus or menu applications, advertisements and promotional flyers. Food service premises must also display information on daily caloric requirements. Ontario’s 36 public health units are responsible for implementation of the Act. The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care developed an implementation guide, fact sheets and a frequently asked questions document to facilitate and streamline implementation.

In 2012, the Minister for Health called on all standard food service businesses to voluntarily display calories on food and drinks served in Ireland under the calorie menu labelling scheme as part of a multi-faceted approach to reduce the burden of overweight and obesity. To assist this, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) published a guide to ensure that the calorie information provided was useful for customers. This guide revolves around four core principles: 1) to provide calorie information on all standard food and drink items sold, 2) to have this information displayed clearly andprominently at the ‘point of choice’ for the consumer, 3) to display this information per portion or per meal and 4) to include information regarding average daily calorie needs so consumers can ‘make sense’ of calorie references on menus.

In October 2011, the (then) Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation endorsed a set of principles to facilitate national consistency if jurisdictions elect to introduce state or territory based legislation for the display of point-of-sale nutrition information in standard food outlets. Based on these national principles the following regulations are in place: The QLD Health Legislation Amendment Act 2016 in the Australian Capital Territory (amendments to Food Regulation 2002 in effect since February 2012) and the states of New South Wales (Food Regulation 2010, in effect since February 2011), South Australia (amendments to Food Regulation 2002 in effect since February 2012), Queensland (amendments to Food Act 2006, passed in March 2016, enforceable from March 2017) and Victoria (amendment to Food Act 1984 in effect since 1 May 2018) require restaurant chains (eg fast food chains, ice cream bars) with ≥20 outlets in the state (or seven in the case of ACT), or 50 or more across Australia, to display the kilojoule content of food products on their menu boards. The display must be clear and legible. Average adult daily energy intake of 8,700kJ must also be prominently featured. Other chains/food outlets are allowed to provide this information on a voluntary basis, but must follow the provisions of the legislation (except in Victoria where voluntary display need not comply with the legislation). Work is currently underway to consider approaches to achieve better national consistency in menu labelling across Australia.

The calorie labelling rule within the NYC Health Code was updated in 2015, with enforcement as of 22 May 2017. All covered food service establishments must now include two new nutrition statements on menus and menu boards (“2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary” and “Additional nutritional information available upon request”), have comprehensive nutrition information on-site and provide it to anyone who requests it, and provide calorie information for multiple-serving standard menu items, combination meals with choices, self-service food, food on display, menu items with a choice of toppings and temporary menu items. This rule affects any establishment that requires a Health Department permit and is part of a chain with ≥15 locations in the US. The updated rule also covers chain food retail establishments that offer restaurant-type food.&nbsp;

The implementing regulations were published by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 December 2014. Despite implementation being&nbsp;delayed several times, the regulation went into effect&nbsp;7 May 2018. Two states (California, Vermont), seven counties (eg King County, WA and Albany County, NY) and two municipalities (New York City, Philadelphia) have already implemented regulations requiring chain restaurants (often chains with more than a given number of outlets) to display calorie information on menus and display boards. These regulations will be pre-empted by the national law once implemented; local governments will still be able to enact menu labelling regulations for establishments not covered by national law (eg food trucks or restaurants not part of a chain which have not self-certified to voluntarily comply with the calorie labelling requirements). The regulations also require vending machine operators of more than 20 vending machines to post calories for food where the on-pack label is not visible to consumers. Implementation for vending machine operators is required by 26 July 2018.

Regulation 1924/2006 establishes EU-wide rules on the use of specified nutrition&nbsp;claims. A nutrition claim is any claim which states, suggests or implies that a food has particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the presence, absence, increased or reduced levels of energy or of a particular nutrient or other substance, and includes claims such as “source of calcium”, “low fat”, “high fibre” and “reduced salt”.&nbsp;The regulation entered into force in the EU in 2007. The body&nbsp;responsible with its implementation in the UK is the Foods Standards Agency (FSA). In England, responsibility for legislation on nutrition and health claims in England transferred from the FSA&nbsp;to the Department Health on 1 October 2010.&nbsp;

In theory, nutrition claims may only be used on food defined as ""healthy"" by a nutrient profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4 of the EU regulation states that nutritional profiles should be established before 2009 in order to lay down guidelines on which foods and / or food groups should be marketed with nutrition and health claims and which should not. This nutrient profiling restriction was due to be implemented in 2010 but no model has yet been established as of 2020. Therefore, permitted nutrition claims can be used as long as the conditions for use of the claim, as set out in the Regulation's annex, are met.&nbsp;

In April 2015, Japan’s Consumer Affairs Agency (CAA), the governmental organisation charged with oversight of food labelling and health claims, introduced a new category of health claim labelling for food called “Food with Functional Claims” (FFC). The other two categories are “Food for Specialized Health Uses” (FOSHU) and “Food with Nutrient Functional Claims” (FNFC), introduced in 1991 and 2001 respectively. Food with Functional Claims (FFC) allows companies to display a product’s specific health benefit (aka “functionality”) and an associated area of the human body on retail food packaging. The FFC registration process is more affordable and faster than the registration process for Food for Specialized Health Uses (FOSHU), which requires clinical trials of a product and individual approval from the CAA. Guidelines exist for FFC labelling contents. FFC claims cannot be made for foods that lead to an excessive intake of fat, cholesterol, sugar and/or sodium. The CAA also revised its regulations for Food with Nutrient Functional Claims (FNFC) in April 2015 to increase product eligibility, expand the list of eligible nutrients, and to include fresh foods.

The rules for the use of health claims are set out in the South Korean Health Functional Food Code, based on Article 17 of Section 3 (Standards, Specifications, Labelling and Advertisements) of the Health Functional Food Act 2004 (which has been amended several times). The Act allows for claims to be expressed in both words and diagrams. The Code lists the wording for allowed claims, sets out standards for manufacturing to be observed for each nutrient, and how much the actual nutrient content of the product may deviate from the labelled content (in percentage, ie&nbsp;beta-carotene must be within 80–150% of the labelled amount). The Code includes the recommended daily intake amount, generally expressed as a range between the minimum to maximum amount. If intake of a nutrient may cause negative health effects, a warning label has to be applied.

Regulation nº 1924/2006 establishes EU-wide rules on the use of specified health claims. The European Commission approves claims provided they are based on scientific evidence and can be easily understood by consumers. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is responsible for evaluating the scientific evidence supporting health claims. It generally considers three types of health claims: 1) the 'Function Health Claims - relating to the growth, development and functions of the body; referring to psychological and behavioural functions; and on slimming or weight-control; 2) the 'Risk Reduction Claims' on reducing a risk factor in the development of a disease; 3) Health 'Claims referring to children's development'.

In theory, nutrition claims may only be used on food defined as ""healthy"" by a nutrient profile. This nutrient profiling restriction was due to be implemented in 2010 but no model has yet been established. Therefore, as of January 2010, only nutrition claims as listed in the EU Regulation’s Annex are permitted. The health claims approved and rejected appear in the EU Commission's register of approved and rejected claims. New approved or rejected health claims are made effective in Spain as soon as possible after they have been adopted by the European Commission.

Regulation 1924/2006 (applicable as of July 2007) establishes EU-wide rules on the use of health claims (claims on nutrient function, disease risk reduction and children's health). This Regulation is also applicable in Switzerland because the government amended its foodstuff law based on its bilateral agreements with the EU to include permitted EU health claims.&nbsp; Companies may only use health claims that are substantiated and authorised by the European Commission and Member States (various regulations authorising health claims to date). The European Food Safety Authority is responsible for verifying the scientific substantiation of claims; it has done so for claims currently in use and continues to do so for claims that are proposed and applied for by companies that want to use health claims in the EU.

Regulation 1924/2006 establishes EU-wide rules on the use of specified&nbsp;health claims. &nbsp;A health claim is any claim that states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health. This would include claims such as “calcium helps maintain normal bones”. More general claims such as “good for you” may also be health claims, and the Regulation takes these into account.

The EU approves claims provided they are based on scientific evidence and can be easily understood by consumers. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is responsible for evaluating the scientific evidence supporting health claims. It generally considered three types of health claims: 1) the 'Function Health Claims' (Article 13)- relating to the growth, development and functions of the body; referring to psychological and behavioural functions; and on slimming or weight-control; 2) the 'Risk Reduction Claims' (Article 14(1)(a)) on reducing a risk factor in the development of a disease; 3) Health 'Claims referring to children's development' (Article 14(1)(b) claims).

The use of disease risk reduction claims is permitted in the US. They are governed by specific rules in the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (1990) and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (1997). There are three categories of claims permitted:


	Claims judged by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to have ""significant scientific agreement"" (currently 12 claims).
	Claims supported by a published, current and authoritative statement by a federal scientific body or the National Academy of Sciences (currently six claims).
	""Qualified claims"": these claims do not meet the above-mentioned standards but may be used if there is some scientific evidence to substantiate the claim provided they include a disclaimer referencing the scientific uncertainty. The FDA considers a number of factors in approving a claim, including the strength of the evidence and potential public health impact.


Health claims are generally not permitted if a food contains more than 13g of fat, 4g of saturated fat, 60mg of cholesterol, or 480mg of sodium. Sugar and whole grain content are not considered.

Companies may make nutrient function claims without notifying FDA, but such claims must be truthful and not misleading. Dietary guidance statements (eg, ""Doctors recommend 3 servings of whole grains per day"") are also permitted without FDA pre-approval but must be truthful and not misleading.

Crunch&amp;Sip® is a vegetable and fruit programme in Australia promoting the consumption of fruit, vegetables and water during class time (""Crunch&amp;Sip time""). It involves students bringing in fruit, vegetables and water from home.

It has since been extended to New South Wales (through the Healthy Kids Association) and South Australia (through the South Australian Dental Service). Funding is currently provided by each of the state governments. Schools participating in Crunch&amp;Sip® are required to ensure that at least 80% of classes and 70% of students participate in the daily fruit and vegetable break. Schools need to endorse a supportive school policy and are encouraged to implement a parent communication strategy and develop curriculum material.

The EU School Fruit Scheme, launched in the 2009-2010 school year, merged with the EU School Milk Scheme on 1 August 2017 into one legal framework based on the Regulation on the new School Fruit, Vegetables and Milk Scheme (Regulation EU No 2016/791). The scheme is funded through the EU’s common agricultural policy and supports the distribution of fruit, vegetables and milk and milk products to schools across the EU as part of a wider programme of education about European agriculture and the benefits of healthy eating. It provides financing to Member States based on the number of school children and level of development of the country.

The implementation of the programmes is at the discretion of national or regional governments, but to receive funding, they must distribute fruit, vegetables and milk products in schools and implement educational measures, such as farm and market visits, educational material distributed to teachers and interactive games on education and nutrition, and regularly monitor and evaluate implementation. Foods containing added sugars, salt, fat, sweeteners or artificial flavor enhances are exempt from the scheme: as an exception, limited quantities of added sugar, salt and fat are allowed if they are approved by the Member States' health/nutrition authorities. The Member States determine the frequency and duration of the distribution of the food.

The scheme provides free fruits, vegetables and milk products to pre-schools and schools in order to increase children’s fruit and vegetable consumption in the long term, to change their eating habits and to combat overweight and obesity. Other aims: educating children to follow a healthy lifestyle, developing healthy eating habits, as well as raising awareness and changing thinking; improving children’s health and quality of life. In 2020/2021 school year more than 666.000 children got free fruits, vegetables and/or milk products regularly in more than 3700 pre-schools and primary schools.

This had been preceeded in 2004 by the “Milk for children” programme. Institutions had to apply the Ministry of Agriculture, if they wanted to participate in the programmes.

First introduced in 2004, the School Fruit Programme (Skolefrukt) allows all Norwegian primary schools to receive a fruit and vegetables subscription. In 2007, the Norwegian government introduced legislation requiring primary schools with lower secondary schools&nbsp;to offer one free piece of fruit or vegetables, five&nbsp;days a week, to pupils&nbsp;(grades 1–10). This was repealed in August 2014, when Skolefrukt became a subscription scheme for all&nbsp;primary schools.&nbsp;

All primary and lower secondary schools can participate in this version of the programme, which can be paid by&nbsp;either&nbsp;parents or by the&nbsp;school/municipality. In the case of a parent-paid scheme, a subscription is taken out for either 1⁄2 year or 1 year at a time. Students get a fresh fruit or vegetable every day (apple, pear, orange, banana, carrot, kiwi, nectarine or clementine, depending on the season). As of August 2020, the offer costs parents NOK 3.60 per day, and is subsidized by the government with NOK 1.50 per fruit / vegetable. Municipalities can offer free fruit / vegetables to their primary school students, covered by the municipal budget. With a municipally paid scheme, it is possible to order fruit / vegetables at the same price and state subsidy as for parents.

The School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme (SFVS) has operated in England since 2004. It was introduced based on the National Health Service (NHS) plan launched in 2000, which included a commitment to implement a national fruit and vegetable scheme by 2004. The School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme is jointly funded by the Department of Health and Social Care and the Department for Education. Four to six-year old children in state-funded infant, primary and special schools throughout England are eligible to receive a free piece of fruit or vegetable every school day outside of their school lunch. There is no statutory requirement for schools to participate in this scheme. The scheme was paused in the summer term 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown, but has restarted as of fall 2020.

There are no national mandatory standards in Australia (see below for details of national voluntary guidelines). However, six states and territories have implemented mandatory standards, which are either based on the national voluntary guidelines or nutrient and food criteria defined by the state: Australian Capital Territory (2015), New South Wales (2011), Northern Territory (2009), Queensland (2007), South Australia (2008), and Western Australia (2014). All of these states and territories identify ""red category"" food, which is either completely banned in schools or heavily restricted (eg&nbsp;offered no more than one or two times per term).&nbsp;The ACT Public School Food and Drink Policy is mandatory for government primary and secondary schools, but not for independent or catholic schools.

Queensland’s Smart Choices&nbsp;school nutrition standards separate food&nbsp;and drinks into green, amber and red categories based on their energy, saturated fat, sugar, sodium and fibre content. Smart Choices ensures that “red” food&nbsp;and drinks are eliminated across the whole school environment.

In February 2014, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) announced the phasing out of sugary drinks for sale in school canteens by the end of 2014. The 2015 ACT School Food and Drink Policy prohibits the sale of sugary drinks in ACT public school canteens.

In 1997, Bermuda implemented the mandatory Healthy Schools Nutrition Policy which contains school food standards including the provision of fruit&nbsp;and vegetables in food service/cafeteria menus and all school events that provide food, limits on the use of food&nbsp;high in salt and sugar, provision of low-fat dairy products, leaner meats, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, the use of lower-fat cooking methods, the consumption of whole fruit&nbsp;and vegetables as preferable to the sole consumption of fruit and vegetable juices and school lunches are required to be consistent with the recommendations of Bermuda’s Daily Dietary Guidelines EatWell Plate.

The Food Service Providers Contract, implemented in 2009 to strengthen the compliance of cafeteria, hot lunch and breakfast vendors in schools, mandates that food&nbsp;provided in schools must be consistent with the Healthy School Nutrition Policy. To monitor compliance, a form exists in which anyone at any school can rate various aspects of a meal provided by a food service provider (eg&nbsp;appropriateness of portion sizes, inclusion of four&nbsp;of five food groups, etc).

The Ministry of Education also has a policy in which only fruit, yoghurt, cheese, crackers and vegetables can be eaten at morning recess.

These requirements contain upper limits for salt, sugar and fat content, and restrict (deep) fried products, sweet treats and soft drinks. School lunches in Estonia are free and there are mandatory requirements that the food must meet. The requirements cover the food given for lunch, but not at school events or for sale in schools but the food for sale must support healthy eating.

This regulation also forbids to offer sugar-sweetened waters, however sugar-sweetened fruit based beverages are allowed. The Regulation establishes requirements for the catering of children and students younger than school age and the energy and nutrient content of food provided to children in children's institutions. When preparing the menu, the average daily food energy and nutrient needs of the age groups are taken as a basis. The food offered for school lunch, including school milk and school bread, must cover 30–35% of the daily food energy and nutrient needs of the respective age group.

It is recommended to cover 20-25% of the daily food energy and nutrient needs of the respective age group with the food offered as school meals. School meals do not replace school lunch. There are also voluntary guidelines for food sold in schools which recommend not to sell or offer any sugar-sweetened drinks in schools.

The recommendations state that drinks available at school meals should include fat-free milk/milk drinks and buttermilk, fortified with vitamin D. Other liquid dairy products and fermented milk products should be fat-free or low-fat products with a maximum fat content of 1%. Cheese products with a fat content of at most 17% and a maximum salt content of 1.2% should be selected. Fresh water should be available as the primary beverage&nbsp;at meals and must be available as the primary beverage to everybody during the whole school day. No soft drinks, energy drinks or any other acidified beverages or beverages with added sugar are served at school.

The school meals recommendation includes guidelines for organizing school meals, cooperating within the school and homes, along with monitoring and evaluating activities. Recommendations on the provision of school meals, snacks and their nutritional quality are given on a menu, food and nutrient-specific basis.

In 2009, legislation required products entitled to EU subsidies under the School Milk Scheme to meet nutritional criteria, including maximum levels of salt content. The criteria are set jointly by the Finnish National Nutrition Council and KELA, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. In August 2017, the legislation was amended so that only fat-free milk and fat-free sour cream are subsidised, and cheese was removed from the subsidy.

Two German states have enshrined the&nbsp;voluntary guidelines on quality standards for school meals by the German Nutrition Society (DGE) in law: Berlin implemented the Law for quality improvements of school lunch meals&nbsp;in 2014 in all-day primary schools. The Law sets the DGE quality standards as a minimum requirement which schools have to adhere to, in addition to setting up a lunch meal committee that regularly conducts quality controls and supports the selection of appropriate food suppliers.

The state of Saarland requires all-day primary and secondary schools to provide school meals that are in line with DGE quality standards (Article 8 of the Regulation of all-day primary and secondary schools).

The DGE guidelines recommend that schools provide water and unsweetened herbal or fruit teas, and prohibit drinks that are high in sugar including juices and energy drinks. The guidelines contain a 20-day plan suggesting serving whole grains on at least four days and potato products a maximum of four days; salad, vegetables or legumes each day; fruit at least eight times; dairy products (ideally low-fat) at least eight times; fish at least four times and meat a&nbsp;maximum of eight times; rapeseed oil is the only permitted oil.&nbsp;

In 2024, the guidelines were updated to reflect that an environmentally friendly and healthy diet is ¾ plant based and ¼ animal based.&nbsp;

The recommendations are as follows:&nbsp;


	Beverages are the largest food group with a daily drinking amount of around 1.5 litres of water.
	5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day&nbsp;
	1 portion of legumes per week&nbsp;
	1 portion of nuts and seeds per day&nbsp;
	5 portions of grain, bread, or pasta per day, of which at least 1/3 should be wholegrain
	1 portion at 10g a day (preferably rapeseed, walnut, flaxseed, soy, or olive oil).
	A maximum of 300g of meat or sausage per week and 120g of Fish
	2 portions of dairy products per day and if plant based alternative are used instead, they should be fortified with B2 and iodine.&nbsp;


The recommendations apply to omnivorous, healthy adults - the next step will be to develop separate recommendations for children and adolescents, as well as people with vegetarian and vegan diets.

Ministerial Orders ( Minister of Health ""On the Approval of the Child Nutrition” (No. V-964 of 2011 and order No V-394 of 2018) established school food standards in Lithuania. In 2018, order No V-394 established the mandatory requirements for the supply of health - friendly food to Lithuanian educational institutions, which apply to all children's education and care institutions in Lithuania. These standards were developed by the Center for Health Education and Diseases Prevention.

The implementation of this system started in 2019. According to it, children must always receive fresh, nutritious food prepared on the same day. Unhealthy foods and drinks, as defined by the Lithuanian food-based dietary guidelines, are prohibited. Every week, children’s meals are monitored by public health professionals working in schools. They are assisted by children and their parents involved in internal nutrition control, as there is an obligation to publish official child nutrition requirements and menus on the websites of educational institutions. The Ministry of Health has published sample menus and technology cards online for children’s educational institutions that can be used by catering providers to ensure healthy nutrition for children.&nbsp;

In September 2014, the Macedonian Ministry of Education’s Rulebook on nutrition standards and meals in primary schools was implemented, setting limits on permissible salt, sugar and fat levels of food served in primary schools. Kindergartens and holiday camps are subject to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy’s Rulebook on standards and norms for services provided by institutions caring for children, implemented in January 2014. It contains intake requirements on calories, carbohydrates, protein, fats, vitamins and minerals based on WHO recommendations. The nutrition standards for kindergartens are widely implemented. The implementation of the elementary school nutrition standards is reported to move at a slower pace, mostly because elementary schools use external catering services which take longer to adjust to the nutrient limits.

In September 2016, the Macedonian Ministry of Education implemented the&nbsp;Rulebook on nutrition standards and meals for the students living in student dormitories.&nbsp;The nutrition standards, based on population-based nutrition guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Institute of Public Health, outline specific nutrient levels (for calories, carbohydrates, protein, fats, sugars, vitamins, minerals) which apply to meals served in all university student dormitories in both public and private dormitories in Macedonia. The nutrition standards include recommended food&nbsp;and dishes for individual meals and recommended frequency of certain food categories.

The National Food Agency was commissioned to work with the Swedish National Agency of Education by the Ministry of Education and Research to develop school food guidelines. The Good School Meals Guidelines, published in 2007 and revised in 2013, are for primary schools, secondary schools and youth recreation centres. The guidelines include age-specific reference values for energy and nutritional content in school lunches and portion sizes, and drinks are limited to water and milk.

Standards for school food came into force on 1 January 2015 and are set out in the requirements for School Food Regulations 2014. Compliance with the School Food Standards is mandatory for all state-funded schools (including all academies and free schools). These school food standards are to ensure that food provided to pupils in school is nutritious and of high quality; to promote good nutritional health in all pupils; protect those who are nutritionally vulnerable and to promote good eating behaviour. The standards are organised by food group, specifically: starchy foods; fruit and vegetables; foods high in fat, sugar, and salt; and healthier drinks. The regulations apply to school lunches provided to registered pupils, whether on the school premises or not. They also apply to food and drink other than lunch, provided to pupils across the school day, including breakfast clubs, tuck shops, mid-morning break, vending machines and after-school clubs.

The US Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010 sets nutrition standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs which were implemented in July 2014 based on an interim final rule published in June 2013. A final rule on nutrition standards for all food&nbsp;sold in schools as required by the HHFKA was published in July 2016, introducing minor changes based on comments received on the interim final rule. The standards for total fat are retained as “interim” in the final rule and may be amended in the future. The Act also establishes guidelines for ""competitive food"" in the Smart Snacks in School Program. Standards include limits on the amount of fat, saturated fat, salt and added sugars permitted in food. Beverages are also restricted to water, low-fat or non-fat milk. Calorie-free carbonated beverages are permitted in high schools.

There are also many state-level rules in place. Some states, including California and Colorado, have restrictions specific to trans fats. For example, in 2008, California adopted Senate Bill No. 1498 which prohibited, as of 1 July 2009, elementary, middle and high schools from making artificial trans fats available through vending machines or school food service establishments during school hours and up to 1/2 hour before and after school hours. In Colorado, Senate Bill 12-086 (2012) prohibits a public school or institute charter school from making available to a student a food item that contains any amount of industrially produced trans fat.

States also have a range of different rules on ""à la carte lines""&nbsp;(ie&nbsp;food options that supplement the school lunch programme choices and stores inside schools).&nbsp;For example, Arizona, Rhode Island and Florida have bans on ""à la carte lines""&nbsp;in elementary schools. 17 other states have strict restrictions (eg&nbsp;specific lists of restricted food&nbsp;or nutritional criteria) that apply at ""à la carte lines""&nbsp;in elementary schools. 15 states have strict restrictions on food&nbsp;available at ""à la carte lines""&nbsp;in middle schools, while 11 states apply strict restrictions at high school level.

Arizona, District of Colombia, Florida and Texas have complete bans on school stores in elementary schools, and 13 states have strict restrictions on the food&nbsp;available in stores in elementary schools. 11 states have strict restrictions on the food&nbsp;available in school stores in middle schools, while eight states apply restrictions at high school level.

It mandated the Ministry of Health to develop standards for food available in canteens and kiosks in schools, prohibited advertising for these same food items, and restricted the availability of salt shakers. The school food standards were elaborated in March 2014 in two further documents: Regulatory Decree 60/014 and the National Plan of Health Promoting Schools.&nbsp;The standards aimed to promote food&nbsp;with “natural nutritional value” with a “minimum degree of processing"" and to limit the intake of free sugars, saturated fat, trans fat and sodium. Limits are set per 100g of food, 100ml of drink and also per 50g portion. Prohibited food includes sugary beverages and energy drinks, confectionery, salty snacks, cakes and chocolate. The school food standards and restrictions on advertising began to be implemented in public schools in 2015 and are being monitored for compliance.

In 2011, Australia introduced the voluntary school food guidelines ""National Healthy School Canteens: guidelines for healthy food&nbsp;and drinks supplied in school canteens” (NHSCGs).&nbsp;The guidelines, updated in 2013,&nbsp;are based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines. The guidelines include three components: a national food categorisation system for school canteens, training materials for canteen staff and an evaluation toolkit. The food categorisation system uses a traffic light system to distinguish food categories that should be promoted and those that should be limited based on their nutritional value: red (not recommended), amber (select carefully) and green (always available). The guidelines provide examples of food&nbsp;within each category and additional nutrient criteria to assist the categorisation of food, mainly in the amber category. Food&nbsp;in the green category should be actively promoted. Food&nbsp;in the red category, such as sugar- and artificially sweetened drinks, food&nbsp;high in sugar, fat and/or salt and food containing excessive energy, should not be sold in school canteens. Implementation of the guidelines is at the discretion of each state or territory government.

The Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Northern Territory (NT) and Tasmania have implemented the national guidelines in full (ACT Public School Food and Drink Policy 2015, NT Canteen, Nutrition and Healthy Eating Guidelines 2013 and Tasmania School Canteen Handbook –&nbsp;a whole school approach to healthy eating 2014) while other states and territories have incorporated components of the guidelines within their own system:


	The Queensland “Smart Choices – Healthy food and Drink Supply Strategy 2004” closely reflects the Australian Dietary Guidelines and the NHSCGs.
	The “South Australia Right Bite, Easy Guide to Healthy Food and Drink Supply for South Australian Schools and Preschools” is based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and uses a traffic light food categorisation system similar to the NHSCGs. &nbsp;
	The Victorian “Go for Your Life – Victorian Health Canteen Policy – School Canteens and other school food services policy 2006” is largely consistent with the NHSCGs except for a few minor nutrient classifications introduced to reflect the evolving food supply. The policy also includes “School Confectionery Guidelines” which categorise confectionery and high sugar content soft drinks as BLACK. The Victorian Government funds the Healthy Eating Advisory Service to support schools to implement the canteen guidelines.
	The Western Australian “Healthy Food and Drink Policy 2014” is based on the Federation of Canteens in Schools nutrient criteria which has been recently revised to include traffic light coding in line with the NHSCGs.


New South Wales (NSW) has taken a different approach. The “NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy 2017” is based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and classifies food and drinks as either ""everyday"" (healthy) or ""occasional"" (less healthy). The strategy also uses the Health Star Rating (see ""N&nbsp;– Nutrition label standards and regulations on the use of claims and implied claims on food"") to guide users in selecting healthier versions of ""occasional"" packaged food.

Schools can voluntarily apply these guidelines to make their canteens and vending machines healthier with (small) changes. The guidelines focus on changing behaviour by adapting canteen environments and thus making healthy choices the easiest ones. This&nbsp;also includes encouraging&nbsp;drinking water.

Based on the changes they make to their food environments, schools can be awarded Silver, Gold or Ideal School Canteen Badges. A canteen is awarded a Silver Badge if at least 60% of their products follow to the Dutch dietary guidelines (the Wheel of Five). To receive a Gold Badge, 80% of products available in the school must meet nutritional criteria, and they must also be presented in an appealing way to students. Silver and Golden Badge Canteens thus give healthier products a leading role, without completely banning unhealthy choices. Schools in which only products from the Wheel of Five are available can receive an Ideal School Canteen Badge.

These guidelines are voluntary, but schools can get tailored free advice from a so–called Healthy Canteen Brigade, set up by the Netherlands Nutrition Centre in order to stimulate implementation.

The National Guideline for Food and Meals in Schools were published in 2015, as a revision of the Guidelines for the School Meal of 2003, but with more details and containing new recommendations. The guidelines are voluntary and include recommendations on the implementation of the meal (meal time, supervision, physical and social arrangements), the nutritional quality of the food and drink offered, food safety and hygiene, and environmental considerations. Specific recommendations are made for primary schools and the after-school programs; secondary schools; and high school. Separate guidelines for kindergartens were also published, which mirror the principles outlines above, but adapt them for younger children.

The guidelines recommend having a varied and mainly plant-based diet, with lots of vegetables, fruits and berries, whole grains and fish, and limited amounts of processed meat, red meat, salt, sugar and saturated fat. Some food and beverages categories should be limited, for example juices to maximum 250ml, completely excluding sweetened and caffeinated beverages, as well as chocolates, crisps and other snacks. Desserts and other products that are high in fat and sugar should be limited for special occasions. The guidelines also recommend limits for salt content: 3–4g&nbsp;per day for under 10s; and 5–6g&nbsp;per day for older students. Finally, the guidelines state that a healthy diet coincides with a more environmentally friendly diet which includes more plant-based food and fish and less meat, especially less red meat.

In 2011, the Health Promotion Board of Singapore, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, launched the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme (HMSP), which was formerly the Model School Tuckshop Programme, launched in 2003. The programme enhances the availability of healthier food and beverage choices in schools through an integrated programme that involves teachers, canteen vendors and students. Canteen vendors from participating schools are expected to follow food service guidelines which aim to reduce the amount of saturated fat, sugar, and salt in school meals and make available whole grains, fruit&nbsp;and vegetables as part of a balanced meal. The Health Promotion Board supports schools by organising culinary and nutrition training for canteen vendors (see “G –&nbsp;Give nutrition education and skills""), and engages nutritionists and dietitians to assess participating schools to ensure compliance to the HMSP criteria. Educational resources are also provided as part of the programme to encourage students to eat a healthy diet. Revised food service guidelines came into effect on 1 January 2016.

The South African Department of Basic Education, in cooperation with the Provincial Education Departments, runs the voluntary National School Nutrition Programme (NSNP), which evolved out of the Primary School Nutrition Programme introduced in 1994. Since 2009, both primary and secondary schools benefit from the programme. More than 20 000 schools take part in the NSNP whereby more than 9 million learners participate on the programme. The programme provides cooked meals which are based on the South African Food Based Dietary Guidelines (2012). Cooked meals consist of a protein, carbohydrate and fresh vegetables or fruit on all school days. Protein used consist of once a week UHT milk or pasteurised maas, pilchards in tomato, soya mince, sugar beans, lentils or split peas. A new product, canned chicken livers are in the process of being introduced on the NSNP menu. The NSNP also promotes vegetable gardens to teach children to grow food and use the produce as part of the school meals. The programme also provides Nutrition Education whereby tuck shop guidelines were developed to advise to sell healthy food (eg fresh fruit, nuts, brown bread sandwiches) and healthy beverages (eg plain water, 100% fruit juice, unsweetened milk).

In 2010, the plenary session of the Interterritorial Council of the National Health System adopted the Document on Standards on Foods Offered in all Educational Settings (DoCACE – Documento de Consenso sobre la Alimentación en los Centros Educativos), with the agreement not only of the health authorities, but also of the educational authorities and scientific societies.&nbsp;

This document establishes nutritional standards for food and drinks offered in school canteens and vending machines, which can be used by regional authorities to&nbsp;determine what food and drinks are allowed.&nbsp;These recommendations&nbsp;apply to all educational settings, including primary and secondary schools.&nbsp;These standards specify how often each food group should be part of weekly menus to meet nutritional standards. The menus must also be developed to meet 35% of daily nutritional needs.

These standards&nbsp;are voluntary in nature, however, educational authorities usually consider them&nbsp;in the preparation of their technical prescriptions for public procurement of menus served in school canteens. Further&nbsp;these standards have been established as mandatory by some&nbsp;auronomous regions.&nbsp;

In addition, Law 17 of 2011 establishes a mechanism for enforcement of these standards across Spain, whereby development of school food menus must also be supervised by a trained nutritionist.&nbsp;

In 2008, the Thai Department of Health, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education’s Office of the Basic Education Commission (OBEC), announced a voluntary ban of soda and sugary packaged snacks in elementary and secondary schools under OBEC. It has been implemented by the majority of schools under OBEC.

The voluntary Thai School Lunch Programme was implemented in 1999, recommending schools to provide meals and snacks in line with the nutrient standards of the Thai Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) (last amended 2003). Three RDIs exist for different age groups: 3–5 years (1,200kcal), 6–12 years (1,550kcal) and 13–18 years (2,000kcal). School meals and snacks should make up 40% of the RDI, and recommend a distribution ratio of 55–60% carbohydrates, 10–15% protein and 25–30% fat. In addition, the RDIs set maximum levels of protein, fat, total carbohydrate&nbsp;and cholesterol, and contain recommended levels of vitamins (A, B1, B2, C), folate and calcium. The guidelines are intended to prevent both undernutrition and overweight/obesity. In 2013, the budget per lunch per pupil was increased from 13 Thai Baht (about US$0.4) to 20 Thai Baht (about US$0.6) to increase the quality of school lunches. Due to a lack of monitoring and evaluation capacity of the Ministries in charge of the programme (Ministry of Education, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Interior), it is unclear how widely the RDIs are implemented.

The Food in Schools Policy is an overarching policy advocating a ‘whole-school approach’ to all food provided and consumed in schools and developing knowledge and skills in relation to healthy eating and lifestyles. It is a joint Department of Education and Department of Health policy which applies to all grant-aided schools. The policy has elements that are mandatory for all schools such as the Nutritional Standards for School Lunches and elements which are strongly recommended but which ultimately schools have discretion to decide upon within their local context, in consultation with pupils, parents and others. From 2007 to 2011 The Education and Training Inspectorate’s Nutritional Associates were in place to monitor the implementation of the policy. No specific funding assigned as it is an overarching policy of existing policies/strategies however specific funding for the implementation of the Nutritional Standards element of the policy was provided until 2015.

A Regional Food in Schools Co-ordinator post is jointly funded by the Department of Health and Department of Education to support the implementation of the Food in Schools policy through provision of expert advice at an operational level and policy support to the funding Departments and arms length bodies.

The cross-organisational Food in Schools Forum has a role in overseeing the strategic implementation the Food in Schools policy at its regular meetings.

Queensland Health was the first to adopt these guidelines in health facilities in 2007. In all jurisdictions, the guidelines are based on the National Health and Medical Research Council’s&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;Dietary Guidelines and Guide to Healthy Eating. Most use a traffic light system&nbsp;to distinguish food&nbsp;that should be promoted, and those that should be limited based on their nutritional value: red (limit), amber (choose carefully) and green (best choices). NSW classifies food and drinks as either ""everyday"" (healthy) or ""occasional"" (unhealthy). To varying degrees, the guidelines in each jurisdiction cover: the types of products available for sale through retail outlets and vending machines; product advertising and promotion; use of products for fundraising, rewards, incentives, prizes and giveaways; catering for meetings and events; and sponsorships. The most comprehensive guidelines make explicit that:


	green products must make up at least 50% of products for sale (ACT, Qld, Vic, WA, NT), ""everyday""&nbsp;food and drinks must make up at least 75% of the offering (NSW)

From 2008 onwards, the Healthy Cafeteria Initiative encouraged the promotion of healthier food options in cafeterias operated in government health facilities. In 2012, a circular by the Director General of Health made the requirements of the Initiative mandatory. In order to receive Healthy Cafeteria recognition, cafeterias need to display the energy content of food items, information on the Recommended Daily Nutrient Intake and a poster or food replica of one food serving containing less than 500 calories. They also have to provide smaller portion sizes for any food items/dishes exceeding 500 calories, sell at least one type of fresh fruit, plain water, and low-sugar drinks. They are not allowed to sell junk and processed food, sweets, premixed drinks, carbonated drinks and alcohol, as well as pickles preserved in salt, sugar and vinegar. The premises have to be smoke-free. In addition, cafeteria operators have to complete the Healthy Catering training (see ""G – Give nutrition education and skills""&nbsp;for more information). As of December 2016, 98% of cafeterias in government health facilities have obtained Healthy Cafeteria status.&nbsp;Since 2012, the Clean, Safe, Healthy Initiative (BeSS) promotes clean, safe and healthy food in food outlets. In order to obtain BeSS recognition, food outlets have to fulfil some of the same criteria as the Healthy Cafeteria Initiative: plain water as default option, low-sugar drinks upon request; at least one type of fresh fruit sold; condiments to be served separately; display of information on dietary intake recommendations and posters/replicas of food items containing less than 500kcal; smaller serving sizes for food&nbsp;containing more than 500kcal promoted; calorie labelling for a minimum of 10 food items, and calorie information displayed for sugar, sugar syrups, creamer and condensed milk.

The Policy was developed by the National Healthy Food &amp; Drinks Environments Network, an alliance of nutrition, dietetic, food service, and/or public health representatives from District Health Boards (DHBs, organisations responsible for providing or funding the provision of health services in their district) across New Zealand, and the Ministry of Health.

The Policy provides guidance on healthy food and drink principles and uses a colour-coded categorisation system to classify items as green, amber, or red based on nutrient criteria standards, ingredients, portion sizes, and/or level of processing. Green food and drinks are consistent with the healthy food and drink principles and are low in saturated fat, added sugar and added salt, and are mostly whole and less processed. Amber foods and drinks are not considered part of an everyday diet but may have some nutritional value. Red foods and drinks are of poor nutritional value and high in saturated fat, added sugar, and/or added salt.

Green items should predominate and make up at least 55% of food and drinks available for consumption, amber items should make up less than 45% of choices available, and red items (including deep-fried foods, confectionery, and sugar-sweetened cold beverages) are not permitted. Additionally, the Policy states that Green foods and drinks should be the most prominently displayed items by retailers and should be readily available in sufficient quantities, competitively priced, and promoted to encourage selection of these options.

The guidelines include guidelines and criteria for creating a balanced meal for an employee. As a practical part of the guidelines, a Practicum of healthy eating menus for workers at work was prepared, which is intended for caterers. The implementation of these guidelines is voluntary.

The Meal Model for public meals outlines minimum voluntary national guidelines for meals served in public institutions such as&nbsp;nursing homes and hospitals, as well as schools (for school food standards, see ""O –&nbsp;Mandatory standards for food available in schools including restrictions on unhealthy food""). The nutritional guidelines are based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, which are based on scientific evidence. Meals should be safe and nutritious, tasty, prepared with good quality ingredients and served in a pleasant environment. The meal should also be eco-smart and integrated into the daily activities in these settings. The Swedish Food Agency is responsible for developing national guidelines for meal services in public institutions.

Since 2012, restaurants and food stores in public hospitals are encouraged to comply with the Department of Health’s Healthy Food Menu policy, which includes the Healthy Menu and the Fatless Belly Menu. The Healthy Menu requires the dish to be cooked using vegetable oil and providing protein (in the form of meat, nuts, or eggs), carbohydrates (rice or noodles), various vegetables and fresh fruit. To comply with the Fatless Belly Menu, the dish should not exceed 400kcal, 15g of fat, 2g of sugar and 600mg of sodium, and it should consist of 50% vegetables, 25% low-fat meat and 25% rice or a starchy carbohydrate.

In 2000, the Ministry of Public Health, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, introduced the voluntary Childcare Centre Standard. Childcare centres are encouraged to comply with nutrition guidelines for children aged 1–3 years and 4–5 years (last updated 2013); the latest survey, conducted in 2014, showed that 61.4% of childcare centres across Thailand met the Standard. The Standard prohibits sugar-sweetened beverages, meat high in fat, the use of salty seasonings (such as fish and soy sauce) and sugar in dishes, and snacks high in sugar and salt, including a ban to bring such snacks to the centres. They include recommendations on portion size for underweight, normal and overweight children as well as the frequency of food groups and meals. In addition, childcare centres have to comply with the Thai Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) (last amended 2003) for 3–5 year olds which are based on 1,200kcal/day and recommend a distribution ratio of 55–60% carbohydrates, 10–15% protein and 25–30% fat. The RDI sets maximum levels of protein, fat, total carbohydrate, and cholesterol, and contains recommended levels of vitamins (A, B1, B2, C), folate and calcium. The Standard and RDI are intended to prevent both undernutrition and overweight/obesity.

Vending machines dispensing crisps, chocolate and sugary drinks are prohibited in National Health Service hospitals in Wales. The Welsh government issued a guidance defining what is allowed and not allowed, and has liaised with major vending providers to find ways to introduce healthier food and drink options (Health Promoting Hospital Vending Directions and Guide 2008). In 2008, the Scottish government issued guidelines to chief executives of the National Health Service on the provision of competitively priced fruit and vegetables in hospital settings and the removal of all soft drinks with a sugar content &gt;0.5g per 100ml from vending machines (unsweetened fruit and vegetable juices are exempt). The 2012 update of the guidelines relaxed this requirement to 70% of drinks having to comply with the sugar limit of 0.5g per 100ml (but some hospital boards choose to retain the complete removal of sugary drinks), and mandated that vending machines must contain prominently positioned water, unsweetened fruit juice and/or low-fat milk. In addition, the guidelines require that at least 30% of snacks/confectioneries and 70% of refrigerated food in hospital vending machines meet the specified criteria of “healthier choices” which set limits on the permissible content of fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt/sodium.

TThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs developed the Government Buying Standards for Food and Catering Services (GBSF) (last updated in March 2015). These standards are mandatory for all central government departments and their agencies, as well as the National Health Service (NHS), prisons and the armed forces. Schools must follow the school food standards legislation but may also choose to use the GBSF too (see above). The wider public sector is encouraged to apply these standards, including to food and drink offered in vending machines (for example in leisure centres).

The GBSF include a set of minimum mandatory standards for inclusion in tender specifications and contract performance conditions, as well as best practice standards which are recommended, but not required. The mandatory nutrition standards include measures to reduce salt and saturated fat consumption, increase fruit and vegetable consumption, set minimum limits for fibre (more than 6g/100g) and maximum limits for sugar (22.5g/100g total sugars) in a proportion of breakfast cereals provided. Further, the standards set minimum limits for serving oily fish. For saturated fat, at least 50% of hard yellow cheese has a maximum total fat content of 25g/100g; at least 75% of ready meals must contain less than 6g saturated fat per portion; at least 75% of milk is reduced fat; and at least 75% of oils and spreads are based on unsaturated fats. Further, meat and meat products, biscuits, cakes and pastries (procured by volume) should be lower in saturated fat, where available.

For fruit and vegetable consumption, at least 50% of the volume of desserts available is based on fruit (fresh, canned in fruit juice, dried or frozen); a portion of fruit should be cheaper than a portion of hot or cold dessert; and meal deals should include a starchy carbohydrate, vegetables and 1 portion of fruit.The GBSF also include best practice standards.

These best practice standards apply to the following categories of food and drink:

– Snacks – Savoury snacks are only available in packet sizes of 30g or less.

– Confectionery

– Confectionery and packet sweet snacks are in the smallest standard single serve portion size available within the market and not to exceed 250kcal.

– Sugar Sweetened Beverages – All sugar sweetened beverages to be no more than 330ml pack size and no more than 20% of beverages (procured by volume) may be sugar sweetened. No less than 80% of beverages (procured by volume) may be low calorie/no added sugar beverages (including fruit juice and water)

– Calorie and allergen labelling – Menus (for food and beverages) include calorie and allergen labelling

.– Menu analysis – Menu cycles are analysed to meet stated nutrient based standards relevant to the major population subgroup of the catering provision.

The Food Policy Coordinator has the responsibility of ensuring adherence with the Food Standards. Self-reported compliance with the standards is 96%. New York City’s Health Code also contains regulations on sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juices served in children’s camps and children’s day care centres. In camps, beverages containing caffeine, artificial sweeteners and non-nutritive sweeteners are banned, and maximum calorie levels and serving portions set. In day care centres, drinks with added artificial and natural sweeteners are banned, and children may only be served a maximum of 4 ounces (118ml) of 100% juice per day; children younger than two do not receive juice.

The Standards include targets for nutrient requirements, including guidelines for specific populations (ie children, elderly). The Standards contain a ban on trans fat and deep-frying, and maximum levels of sodium in food and calorie levels of beverages. They are applicable to food served to agencies’ clients and patients (ie hospitals, prisons, childcare services); food served for sale, and to agencies’ employees is excluded.

In effect since October 2011, Boston's Healthy Beverage Executive Order directs city departments to eliminate the sale of sugar-sweetened beverages on city property and to adhere to the City of Boston's Healthy Options Beverage Standards (developed by the Boston Public Health Commission) in all vending machines, and city-managed food and beverage services programmes, contracted food or beverage services, food or beverage procurement, leases and other agreements for food or beverage concessions in or around city-owned buildings.  The Healthy Options Beverage Standards outline the requirements for beverages that can be sold: no calorically-sweetened cold beverages; fruit and/or vegetable beverages must be 100% juice and where possible servings shall not exceed 8 ounces or 150 calories and be low-sodium varieties; milk, soy milk and other milk substitute offerings are limited to 1% or skim milk, not exceeding 12 ounces in volume with &lt;25g of total sugars per 8 ounce serving; diet or other non-calorically sweetened beverages should be less than one third of total beverage offerings.   In addition, only products that qualify as Healthy Options Beverages are permitted to be promoted on vending machines (eg sides, front graphic panel, etc).   When the Executive Order was issued, the Healthy Options Beverage Standards were visualised on point-of-decision education materials through a traffic light system (eg ""drink rarely, if at all"" (red), ""drink occasionally"" (yellow), and ""drink plenty"" or ""healthy choice"" (green).

Norway&nbsp;has a generalised tax on sugar since 1981, which is payable on sugar that’s either imported into Norway or produced in Norway. As above, the tax is primarily a source of revenue, however the Norwegian government have acknowledged it can also have a health effect. In 2020, the tax rate was set at NOK8.20 per kg of the product’s taxable weight. Among other things, the tax is payable on the following types of sugar: granulated sugar, icing sugar, rock candy, refined and pearl sugar. The tax does not apply when sugar is used as an ingredient in another product, such as in baked goods, mineral water, chocolate and soft drink factories.

Further, the tax on non-alcoholic beverages was raised by 42%, at a rate of NOK4.75&nbsp;per litre. In January 2019 the tax rate on chocolate and sugar products was reduced to (price adjusted) 2017-level. In 2020, the tax rate for chocolate and sugar products was set at NOK 21.22 per kg.

On August 31, 2020, the Act of February 14, 2020 amending certain acts in connection with the promotion of pro-health consumer choices was published (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1492), which entered into force on January 1, 2021.

The tax will be set at PLN 0.5 (EUR 0.11) in the case of a sugar content equal to or less than 5g in 100mL of the drink, with an additional fee of PLN 0.05 (EUR 0.01) per each gram of sugar above 5g/100mL.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, an additional fee applies to the introduction of beverages with the addition of:

• sugars that are monosaccharides or disaccharides and foodstuffs containing these substances and sweeteners referred to in the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC)

• caffeine or taurine.

The purpose of the introduced regulations was to use the fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthy consumer choices - to improve eating habits by limiting the consumption of sweet drinks. It is expected that the fee, as a tool used in counteracting civilization diseases, will change the consumption structure in the beverage category, which will result in savings for the health care system in the longer term (improvement in health indicators, reduction of overweight and obesity rates and diet-related diseases). The vast majority (96.5%) of the funds obtained from the so-called The sugar levy will go to the National Health Fund (NFZ), while the remaining part (3.5%) will be transferred to the state budget.

The expected revenues to the NHF budget in the first year of the fee being in force are about PLN 3 billion, which will be allocated to the implementation of educational and preventive activities as well as health care services related to maintaining and improving the health of beneficiaries with diseases developed due to improper health choices and behaviors , especially those who are overweight and obese.

The Sugar Sweetened Beverage Product Distribution Tax is a voter-initiated tax that was adopted by Boulder voters in the November 2016 election. The revenue will be spent on health promotion, general wellness programmes and chronic disease prevention that improve health equity such as access to safe and clean drinking water, healthy foods, nutrition and food education, physical activity, and other health programmes especially for residents with low income and those most affected by chronic disease linked to sugary drink consumption. Those who fail to file their returns and remit tax payments will be subject to enforcement action.

Launched on 1 April&nbsp;2011, Nutrition North Canada (NNC) is a government of Canada subsidy programme that helps provide northerners in isolated communities with improved access to perishable, nutritious food. NNC provides a retail-based subsidy that enables local retailers and registered suppliers to access and lower the cost of perishable healthy foods like meat, fish, eggs, milk and bread, as well as fruit and vegetables, all of which must be transported by air to these isolated communities. NNC also subsidises commercially processed country or traditional foods such as Arctic char, muskox, and caribou. NNC has two subsidy levels: level 1, which is the higher subsidy, is granted to foods that are deemed the most perishable and most nutritious; while level 2, the lower subsidy, is applied to other staple food items.

Eligibility is based on isolation factors and focuses on communities that lack year-round surface access (no permanent road, rail&nbsp;or marine access) requiring goods to be flown in. Effective 1 October&nbsp;2016, 121 northern communities had full access to the NNC subsidy. Four criteria inform subsidy rates, which vary across communities: 1) geographical distance from the supply centre to the isolated community, 2) distance flown, 3) population according to the census, and 4) minimum wage.

Residents in eligible communities can purchase subsidised food from registered northern retailers. Individuals, local restaurants&nbsp;and social institutions can also access the subsidy by ordering eligible items directly from registered suppliers. Retailers and suppliers are responsible for passing on the full subsidy to consumers and participate in regular compliance reviews as part of their agreement with the department of indigenous and northern affairs Canada. In order to increase programme transparency, on 1 April&nbsp;2016, NNC implemented a mandatory point-of-sale system allowing customers to clearly see the application of the NNC subsidy on their grocery receipts.

In 2010, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health partnered with The Food Trust to launch Philly Food Bucks&nbsp;as part of Get Healthy Philly, a public health initiative that promotes healthy eating, active living and smoking cessation. The Philly Food Bucks programme incentivises recipients of income assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, to purchase fresh produce. For every $5 spent using SNAP at a participating farmers’ market, shoppers receive $2 in Philly Food Bucks, which are redeemable for fresh produce. The Philly Food Bucks programme increases the purchasing power of low-income shoppers by 40% and increases access to fruit&nbsp;and vegetables. Between 2010 and 2016, over $350,000 worth of fresh fruit&nbsp;and vegetables have been purchased with Philly Food Bucks, and SNAP sales at participating farmers’ markets have increased by more than 300%. In 2015, with the support of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, local foundations and funding provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through its Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant programme, The Food Trust expanded the Philly Food Bucks initiative to other retail settings in the State of Pennsylvania, including supermarkets, corner stores, mobile markets, and additional farmers’ markets. Results from a supermarket pilot showed a 49% increase in produce purchasing among&nbsp;SNAP shoppers who participated in the Food Bucks programme. Funding for the programme’s expansion is currently secured until March 2018.

""The 2010 UK Code of Broadcast Advertising (BCAP Code), replacing the 2007 scheduling restrictions, prohibits advertising and product placement of food high in fats, sugars and salt, as defined by a nutrient profiling model published by the Food Standards Agency in December 2005, during and adjacent to TV and radio programmes with a particular appeal to viewers under the age of 16 (includes sponsorship of TV programmes).

A “particular appeal” is assumed for programmes commissioned for, or principally directed at children under the age of 16, and those reaching an indexing score of 120 and above (the indexing score is calculated as follows: [% of all children aged 4–15 watching / % of people watching out of the total viewing population] x 100). In 2016, Public Health England started a review of the nutrient profiling model specifically in the context of the BCAP Code which has not yet been published (as of 2023). The advertising restriction system is paid for by industry and enforced by the independent Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) which operates under a contract from Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator. The Advertising Code is written and maintained by the BCAP committee.

The ASA is the independent co–regulatory body responsible for administering the Code, whereby the advertising restrictions system is funded by industry. This Code sets out the rules with which television broadcasters licensed by Ofcom must comply when carrying advertising. Advertising in children's programmes is prohibited during children’s programmes with a scheduled duration of 30 minutes or less. The transmission of children’s programmes with a scheduled duration of longer than 30 minutes may be interrupted by advertising or teleshopping once for each scheduled period of at least 30 minutes.

The Finnish Consumer Protection Act (1978, last updated 2016) regulates all marketing targeting consumers, including food marketing to children. The Consumer Ombudsman’s Guidelines: Children and Foodstuffs Marketing (2004, developed in cooperation with the National Public Health Institute and Finnish food safety authority) set out how to apply the Consumer Protection Act. These guidelines deal with the interpretation of guides published rather than provisions&nbsp;of the Food Act, but their interpretation is clarified in control guides published by the Food Agency.

The Guidelines specify that the purpose of food advertisements must be explicit, that the way of presenting cannot be misleading and that advertising practices should not encourage unhealthy dietary habits in children. They also advise to take special care when using marketing techniques with a special appeal to children. Neither the Consumer Protection Act nor the Guidelines define what unhealthy dietary habits and marketing techniques with a special appeal to children are. Whether food marketing to children violates these requirements is decided on a case-by-case basis by the Consumer Ombudsman and the Market Court (the court that hears marketing cases based on the Consumer Protection Act).

Considerations regarding the age-appropriateness of marketing are also made on a case-by-case basis, independent of the general definition of a child being a person under the age of 18 under Finnish law. The Guidelines, which are not legally binding, were developed taking into consideration the Market Court’s case law, and contain examples of cases where marketing was found to violate the Consumer Protection Act. Examples are competitions that a child can only participate in if the product is bought; using collectible toys; giving the impression that buying the advertised food will make the child more popular; and masking advertisement as a story. During the past decade, the Consumer Ombudsman has not had cause to take any case concerning food marketing to children to the Market Court, and has instead successfully collaborated with industry to align marketing practices with the Guidelines.

Advertising in general is prohibited in the premises used by pre-school childcare institutions, basic schools, gymnasiums and vocational education institutions.Following the EU’s Audivisual Media Services Directive, Estonia updated the law by asking the Broadcasters to implement a self-regulation to limit the marketing of high fat, sugar, salt and trans fat foods to children. This self-regulation is implemented from 1st of Jan, 2023 and follows the WHO and EU co-created NPM. However, it only applies to audiovisual media and does not include digital marketing, direct marketing and campaigns in public spaces. Also, it only covers children up to 12 years old.&nbsp;
Additionally, the marketing law states that advertising can not take place on school territory (primary and secondary). Consumer Protection Agency has created a guideline to help follow the laws regarding marketing towards children, which means all marketing that is targeted towards children under 18 years of age. It adds that marketing towards children can not promote brand loyalty.

Non-broadcast media is defined as all forms of digital media, out of home media, print media and cinema. The overarching objective of the codes is to reduce exposure of the Irish population to marketing initiatives relating to foods that are high in fat, sugar and/or salt (HFSS foods) identified using the Nutrient Profile model used by the Broadcast Authority of Ireland. The codes were developed by a multi-sector group and sit alongside and complement other measures in place in Ireland, including the Advertising Standards Authority For Ireland (ASAI) Code of Standards for Advertising and Marketing Communications (see above - Mandatory regulation of broadcast food advertising to children and Mandatory regulation of specific marketing techniques).

For non-broadcast media, marketing communications for HFSS food and drink should not be booked on children’s media (defined by the Code as created specifically to be used and enjoyed by those under the age of 15 and/or those whose audience or user profile consists of 50% or more of this age group) and marketing communications carried outside of children’s Media which are targeted at children shall not include licensed characters and celebrities popular with children or use either promotions or competitions. In addition, displays of HFSS foods are restricted from 100 meters of schools and HFSS food sponsorship of sports pages or sports supplements is not allowed. Locations primarily used by children (e.g. registered creches, pre-schools, nurseries, family and child clinics, pediatric services, schools, dedicated school transport, playground and youth centers) are free from all forms of marketing communication for HFSS foods.

The Codes are voluntary in nature, and monitored by the Department of Health or its designated monitoring body, including an annual report for the Minister which covers effectiveness and complaints. Companies and partner organisations who sign up to the Codes are published in a register of signatories and are committed to comply with the rules agreed upon in the Codes of Practice.

A voluntary initiative was implemented in 2014 supplementing exiting laws in restricting marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children and adolescents (existing rules can be found under&nbsp;""Mandatory regulation of broadcast food advertising to children"" above). This self-regulatory scheme applies to a wide range of communications channels, such as online and in cinemas. It applies to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children under the age of 13. A code and supplementary guidance, and a product list of food and beverages (energy-dense, salty, sweet or nutrient-poor foods) are established that specify the scope of the scheme.

The Food and Drink Industry Professional Practices Committee (MFU) monitors compliance with the code and guidance, and handles complaints and violations. The MFU also gives pre-judgements on future campaigns. The MFU was established by industry. The Norwegian Directorate of Health represents the health authorities in the MFU. A website has been created which includes a complaints form, see: www.mfu.as. This ban also applies to advertising in cinemas in connection with films that are specifically aimed at children under the age of 13 (and which start before 18:30), interactive games specifically aimed at children and all types of competitions with an age limit lower than 13 years. However, marketing techniques such as packaging, shelf location and sponsorships have been excluded from the MFU definition of marketing ever since the scheme was introduced.

The MFU code is designed to protect against marketing aimed specifically at children under the age of 13. In terms of marketing aimed at young people, the self-regulation scheme states that the food and drink industry should exercise caution and consideration in respect of their age and development.

In 2005, the Spanish Self-regulatory Code for Food and Non-alcoholic Beverage Advertising Aimed at Children (Código de Autoregulación de Publicidad de Alimentos y Bebidas No Alcohólicas dirigida al Público Infantil - the&nbsp;PAOS Code) was&nbsp;developed between government and industry. The code&nbsp;sets general guidelines for broadcast and online advertising&nbsp;and restricts product placement and use of celebrities in food advertising for signatories. The Code applies to advertising on audiovisual and print media to&nbsp;children aged 12 or under; and&nbsp;to online advertising to children aged 15 or under.&nbsp;

The PAOS Code &nbsp;was strengthened in 2012 as part of the&nbsp;application of the Law of Food Security and Nutrition of 2011, of which articles 45 and 46 mandate the creation of co-regulatory or&nbsp;self-regulatory mechanisms with economic entities with the purpose of limiting foods and drinks advertising aimed children under 15 years old.

There are two enforcement mechanisms associated with the PAOS Code for broadcast media. First, copy advice carried out by the Asociación para la autorregulación de la comunicación comercial (AUTOCONTROL). Though this, proposed advertising directed at children is presented on a voluntary basis for control, prior to the broadcast of the advertisement on television. This prior consultation, which is confidential and binding, is mandatory for all companies that sign the PAOS code. Second, when a complaint or claim occurs, a post-hoc resolution process occurs, which is split between AUTCONTROL and an independent body called Jurado de la Publicidad. Ongoing monitoring of the implementation of these rules is carried out by a Monitoring Commission, whose members are government representatives, representatives of industry and representatives of a Consumers and Users Council.&nbsp;

The enforcement mechanism associated with the PAOS Code for online media is undertaken through the tools provided by the Institute Infoades and Comscore, which search and analyse content by brands that perform advertising aimed at children under 15 years. Ongoing monitoring of the implementation of these rules is carried out by a Monitoring Commission, whose members are government representatives, representatives of industry and representatives of a Consumers and Users Council.

The CAP Code applies to non-broadcast media just like BCAP to broadcast media, and the same nutrient profile model is used. It covers non-broadcast advertising (for example print, online), sales promotion and direct marketing (such as telesales and email). The code specifies standards for accuracy and honesty that businesses must stick to, including on advertising to children. Advertisements for high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) products must not be directed at people under 16 through the selection of media or the context in which they appear. No medium should be used to advertise HFSS products, if more than 25% of its audience is under 16 years of age. Additionally, where the content is likely to be seen as directly targeting under-12s, it cannot include promotions, or licensed characters or celebs popular with under-16s. These restrictions apply to ads that promote HFSS products directly and those that have the effect of promoting specific HFSS products through the use of ‘branding’ that is synonymous with a HFSS product or a range of products that is mainly HFSS.

The CAP Code is a self-regulatory system (unlike the BCAP&nbsp;which is co-regulatory). That means that&nbsp;the CAP Code&nbsp;is&nbsp;written and maintained by an industry committee, and the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) functions as an&nbsp;independent self–regulatory body responsible for administering the Code, whereby the advertising restrictions system is funded by industry. However, the Department of Health, Public Health England (PHE) and the Foods Standards Agency regularly dialogue with CAP. Thus, there is implicit government&nbsp;support of this self-regulatory scheme.

A committee of volunteer experts from the public sector (eg research institutes, hospitals, universities and public schools) reviews the proposed charters. To date, over 35 companies have made voluntary commitments, which are reviewed and approved by an external committee of experts to ensure they are “significant”.

The Agreement to Improve Product Composition (2014 – 2020) was reached by industry sector associations, supermarkets, caterers, restaurants and the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports. The voluntary targets for reformulation are set yearly by these partners. In 2020, the agreement targets were set at a maximum of 6g salt intake per day, a maximum of 10% of energy from saturated fat, and for continued reductions in energy, sugar, fat, and portion sizes, along with increased fruit and vegetable consumption.&nbsp;

These targets are set based on the Dutch dietary guidelines, the so-called Wheel of Five, and they apply to food categories as follows: salt (ready-made meals, dressings and spice mixes), salt and sugar (vegetable preserves), salt and saturated fat (minced meat products, crisps/chips other than paprika-flavoured), sugar (satay sauce) or portion size (candy, cakes, snacks, chocolate).&nbsp;

The Agreement is reached within the business community by making sector-wide agreements for various product categories. This is done based on measuring the contribution for each product group to population intake of salt, saturated fat and calories per product group. Compliance with the maximum levels agreed is checked annually by the sector organizations with their members. Further, the National Institute for Health and Environment (RIVM) undertakes monitoring at product level. It is expected for the agreement for be renewed after it ends in 2020.

Since 2007, the New Zealand Heart Foundation has received funding from the government to implement a national food reformulation programme. The programme –&nbsp;HeartSAFE (Sodium Advisory and Food Evaluation) – focuses on salt reduction in packaged food. Best Practice Guidelines have been established as orientation for food manufacturers, outlining maximum levels of sodium in mg per 100g for bread, breakfast cereals, soups, processed meat, savoury pies, savoury snacks, cheese, cooking sauces and edible oil spreads including proposed timelines until 2017 for reformulation. For savoury pies, maximum levels of saturated fat in g per 100g are also included. The programme's objective is to achieve at least 80% of the market share (by sales volume) to meet the targets, which ensure high-volume food&nbsp;is prioritised. Currently in the majority of categories (eg&nbsp;bread, breakfast cereals, processed meats) this objective has been met and, as a result, over 210 tonnes of salt has been removed from these categories. Work is currently being done on establishing best practice guidelines for further categories.

As part of the Letter of Intent on Facilitating a Healthier Diet, health authorities have established the Salt Partnership in collaboration with the food industry, catering and restaurant industry and other research and interest groups in 2015. The principal objective of the Salt Partnership is to implement the process of reducing salt in foods and served dishes to achieve a 15% reduction in the population salt intake (to 8.5g/day) by 2018, 20% (to 8g/day) by 2021 and 30% (to 7g/day) by 2025. The partnership includes a series of standards that aim to reduce the population salt intake. As such, the partnership set recommended targets for salt content in about 100 food categories, such as bread, meat, fish, dairy as well as specific products (ready-made meals, salad dressing, flavourings, sauces, salads, pastries, snacks and preserved foods). The Salt Partnership has been extended to 31 December 2021. New targets for salt content in foods are set to meet the target of 8g&nbsp;of salt per day in the population.

The Salt Partnership existed from 2015 to 2021, as an agreement between the Norwegian Directorate of Health, food producers, the catering industry, trade and industry organisations, R&amp;D and interest organisations.From 2022, the work on salt reduction continues as part of the Partnership for a healthier diet.

The evidence setting out the need for the sugar reduction programme was published in October 2015 by Public Health England (PHE) in ‘Sugar reduction: the evidence for action’. The voluntary sugar reduction programme challenged all sectors of the food industry – retailers, manufacturers, and the eating out of home sector (for example, restaurants, pubs and cafes, takeaway and delivery) - to reduce sugar by 20% by 2020 in the categories of food that contribute most to the sugar intakes of children aged up to 18 years, including a 5% reduction in the first year of the programme.

In March 2017 PHE published guidelines for the total sugar content per 100g, and for the calorie content of products likely to be consumed on a single occasion, for the food categories included in the programme: biscuits; breakfast cereals; cakes; chocolate confectionery; ice cream, lollies and sorbets; morning goods (such as pastries and buns); puddings; sweet confectionery; sweet spreads and sauces; and yogurts and fromage frais. These were designed to help industry achieve the 20% reduction ambition. The reductions in sugar should also be accompanied by reductions in calories, no increase in saturated fat and achievement of salt targets, where possible (see below). Annual monitoring reports have beeen published, detailing industry progress towards the 20% reduction ambition. It also reports on changes in the drinks that are subject to the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) (see """"U – Health–related food taxes"""").

In May 2018 PHE published guidelines for every sector of the drinks industry to reduce the overall sugar content of juice based drinks by 5% and milk based drinks by 20% by 2021, with an interim ambition for milk based drinks of a 10% reduction by 2019. The sugar reduction achieved for juice based drinks and milk based drinks, where possible, are to be accompanied by calorie reduction (see below).

Prior to 2017, when salt reduction became part of the voluntary reduction and wider reformulation programme that OHID now oversees, 4 sets of voluntary salt reduction targets for individual categories of food have been published (in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2014). The latest set of revised salt targets were published in September 2020 and are for industry to achieve by 2024. The main 2024 salt reduction targets apply to 28 broad product categories comprising 84 sub-categories of food and drink. There are also separate salt reduction targets set per serving specifically for businesses that provide the meals that we buy and eat out of the home, takeaway or have delivered to the home. The next progress report is expected to be published in 2024.

In England, through the government’s Responsibility Deal launched in 2011, the food industry made voluntary commitments (pledges) to reformulate their products to reduce salt, saturated and trans fats, and calories. In March 2014, the government introduced new salt reduction targets covering 76 categories of food to be met by 2017, along with new salt targets for the most popular meals consumed out of home. All major supermarkets and many big manufacturing and catering brands signed up to achieve these salt reduction targets, which replaced the original salt reduction pledge. The Responsibility Deal was operational during the coalition government from 2010 to 2015.

The National Salt Reduction Initiative in the US, initiated in 2009, was a partnership of more than 100 state and local health authorities and national health organisations, coordinated by the New York City Health Department. It set voluntary targets for salt levels in 62 categories of packaged food and 25 categories of restaurant food to guide food company salt reductions of 25% by 2014, with an intermediary milestone in 2012. The initiative included mechanisms to monitor sodium in the food supply to track companies’ progress towards specific targets, and to monitor changes in people’s actual salt intake. To maintain momentum, the New York City Board of Health approved the sodium warning rule in 2015 (see “N – Nutrition label standards and regulations on the use of claims and implied claims on food""). In June 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced draft voluntary sodium reduction targets, which were partly informed by the design of the National Salt Reduction Initiative.

Food manufacturers had three years to remove PHOs from products. As of 18 June 2018, food manufacturers and restaurants are no longer allowed to produce foods that contain PHOs.&nbsp;Several local bans of trans fat exist for food establishments (eg&nbsp;New York City, California; see ""S – Set incentives and rules to create a healthy retail and food service environment"").

Ghana set standards in the early 1990s to limit the level of fats in beef, pork, mutton and poultry in response to rising imports of low-quality meat following liberalisation of trade. The standards are also applicable to domestically produced meat. The relevant standards establish maximum percentage fat content for de-boned carcasses/cuts for beef (&lt;25%), pork (&lt;25%) and mutton (&lt;25% or &lt;30% where backfat is not removed), and maximum percentage fat content for dressed poultry and/or poultry parts (&lt;15%). The standards are currently being enforced for turkey tails and chicken feet.

Since 2014, Lithuania bans the sale of energy drinks to children in order to protect children's health from sugary drinks and psychoactive substances. This ban has been implemented as a result of an amendment to the Law on Food, Article 6 (1) which prohibits the sale of energy drinks to children under 18. Further, Article 14.5 of the Law on Advertising mandates a ban on advertising of energy drinks to children under 18. Lithuania was the first in the world to introduce such measures. Energy drinks are defined as non-alcoholic beverages excluding coffees, containing at least 150mg caffeine per litre independent of whether other stimulants are added.

In February 2014, the US Congress formally established the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI). This follows a three-year pilot established in 2011, in which over $140m&nbsp;was distributed in grants to states to provide financial and/or other types of assistance to attract healthier retail outlets to under-served areas.

To date, 23 US states have implemented financing initiatives. For example, the New Jersey Food Access Initiative provides affordable loans and grants for costs associated with building new supermarkets, expanding existing facilities, and purchasing and installing new equipment for supermarkets offering a full selection of unprepared, unprocessed, healthy food&nbsp;in under-served areas; the Initiative targets both for-profit and not-for-profit organisations and food cooperatives. More information on state-based initiatives can be found at the Healthy Food Access Portal weblink below.

There are also initiatives at the city level. For example, in 2008, New York City made 1,000 licences for Green Carts available (through Local Law 9). Green Cart licences were issued to street vendors who exclusively sell fresh fruit and vegetables in neighbourhoods with limited access to healthy food.

In 2009, New York City established the Food Retail Expansion to Support Health Program of New York City (FRESH). Under the programme, financial and zoning incentives are offered to promote neighbourhood grocery stores offering fresh meat, fruit and vegetables in under-served communities. The financial benefits consist of an exemption or reduction of certain taxes. The zoning incentives consist of providing additional floor area in mixed buildings, reducing the amount of required parking, and permitting larger grocery stores as-of-right in light manufacturing districts.

There are no restrictions on the management method (independent, licensed or mixed), nor on the size of the canteen, provided that it offers at least a full meal service several days a week. The criteria for awarding the label includes a series of elements with a focus on sustainability. Among these, healthy nutrition is&nbsp;considered, particularly with regards to key nutrients (e.g., reducing sugar-sweetened beverages, levels of fat in meals) or establishing smaller portion sizes. Other criteria refer to serving seasonal fruits and vegetables, that are produced locally. The label does not cover restaurants, which, unlike canteens, do not target members of a community on a recurring basis, but individuals on an ad-hoc basis.

In order to do this, schools must improve food standards in canteens, for example trough Healthy School Canteen (see “O–– Voluntary guidelines for food available in schools”), but also pay structural attention to nutrition education in class. The Netherlands Nutrition Centre (Voedingscentrum) developed teaching packages for primary, secondary and vocational schools to support schools in providing nutrition education. As this is a voluntary programme, schools can get support free of charge to obtain certificates, but do not get funding for implementation of the programme.

The partnership was signed on December 6th, 2016 and lasts until 31st December 2021.The overall goal is to increase the proportion of the population who has a balanced diet in accordance with the dietary guidelines, and to contribute to achieve the targets of World Health Organization for reduction in premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases by 25 percent within 2025.

The agreement contains specific goals related to reducing the intake of salt, added sugar and saturated fat, and increasing the intake of fruits and berries, vegetables, whole grain foods, fish and seafood in the population. There is also a goal of increasing the sale of foods labelled with the Keyhole label. The partnership includes grocery stores and food service outlets (cantinas, restaurants, kiosks, gas stations etc.). In the partnership the partners have several obligations.

The food service outlets and groceries should promote healthier alternatives and options that support the main goals in the partnership (reduce intake of salt, added sugar, saturated fat and increase intake of fruit and vegetables, whole grain and fish). Other obligations is to make healthier choices easier by innovating, reformulating, changing portion size and developing new and healthier products. As part of the evaluation of the partnership, the shops have reported on specific actions to increase the availability of healthier foods. The type of measures are for example development of new products/dishes, optimisation of existing products/dishes (reformulation), product placement, marketing and labelling/packaging.(See H-&nbsp;Governance structures for multi-sectoral/stakeholder engagement and I1- Voluntary food reformulation)

As part of the Healthier Dining Programme&nbsp;launched in Singapore in June 2014 (formerly called the Healthier Hawker&nbsp;Programme, launched in 2011), food operators are encouraged to offer lower calorie meals and use healthier ingredients such as oils with reduced saturated fat content, and/or whole grains, without compromising taste and accessibility. To participate, food and beverage companies must complete an application form and implement nutrition guidelines set by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) in all outlets for a period of two years. Following HPB&nbsp;approval the Healthier Choice Symbol Identifiers&nbsp;(see ""N – Nutrition label standards &amp; regulations on the use of claims and implied claims on food"") are used next to&nbsp;healthier dishes in all menu and marketing materials to help consumers identify healthier dishes (eg&nbsp;""We serve lower-calorie options"", ""We use healthier oil"").

To date, the HPB has partnered with 45 widely known food service providers (food courts, coffee shops, restaurants) to offer lower calorie and healthier meals across 1,500 outlets and stalls. Between the launch of the programme and September 2015, the number of healthier meals sold more than doubled, from 525,000 in June 2014 to 1.1 million in September 2015. The government increases the availability and use of healthier ingredients through a subsidy scheme called the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme&nbsp;(see ""H – Harness supply chain and actions across sectors to ensure coherence with health"").

As part of the same programme, the Health Promotion Board also&nbsp;offers a Healthier Dining Grant to food and beverage establishments to help promote healthier menu choices. The grant reimburses up to 80%&nbsp;of establishments’ marketing and publicity costs related to the promotion of their healthier dishes. Establishments under the Healthier Dining Programme are eligible to apply for the grant every two years, with incremental commitment of healthier dishes after the initial grant period.

Local councils are encouraged to develop Healthier Catering schemes or awards. The initiatives encourage outlets to switch to healthier ingredients, menus and cooking practices, based on Public Hearth England’s Healthier and more sustainable catering guidance. They focus particularly on reductions in salt, fat and sugar, smaller portions, and inclusion of more fruit and vegetables and the provision of calorie information. These are generally led and managed by staff from environmental health or trading standards teams of local authorities who are able to build on their established relationships with local outlets. They frequently draw on behavioural economics, encouraging consumers to make healthier choices through, for example, promoting the sale of food in smaller containers or the placing of healthier drinks at eye level.

In 2020, PHE England published a guidance and supplementary planning document template for local authority public health and planning teams with the purpose of using the planning system to promote healthy weight environments.

To receive a Healthy Choice Award, businesses must meet nutrition criteria (revised in 2015) and have a compliant food hygiene rating. Successful businesses can display a window sticker and certificate, and the details of award holders are listed on the council website. The Healthy Choice scheme is open to takeaways, cafes and restaurants, as well as outlets operating in early years and residential care settings.

In 2012, the Philadelphia Healthy Chinese Take-Out Initiative was established in partnership with Temple University’s Center for Asian Health, the Asian Community Health Coalition, the Greater Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. The aim of the initiative is to reduce the sodium content of dishes and to promote awareness of the impact of sodium consumption on health.

Dishes from Chinese take-out restaurants contain large amounts of sodium, mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. In Philadelphia, there are approximately 400 Chinese take-out restaurants clustered in low-income and high-risk communities. As part of the initiative, restaurant owners and chefs received support and training on reducing sodium in their menu (see ""G – Give nutrition education and skills""). Common sodium reduction strategies implemented by the restaurant staff included enhancing flavours with herbs and spices, using less sauce and switching to lower sodium ingredients. The programme helped decrease sodium levels in the three most common dishes served by 181 Chinese take-out restaurants by about 30% over 36 months in 2015. This successful model is now being replicated in Chinese buffet restaurants in Philadelphia.

The National Planning Policy Framework sets out that planning policies and decisions should aim to achieve healthy, inclusive and safe places which enable and support healthy lifestyles, including through access to healthier food. National planning guidance enable local authorities to limit the opening of new hot food takeaways close to schools and in areas of over-concentration and high obesity rates where supported by evidence. Local planning policies and guidance to control the over-concentration and proliferation of hot food takeaways should form part of a local authority-wide approach for tackling obesity and should involve a range of different departments and stakeholders.Around 15 local authorities in the UK have developed supplementary planning documents on the development of hot food takeaways.

The policies typically exclude hot food takeways from a 400m zone around the target location (eg primary schools). For example, Barking and Dagenham’s Local Borough Council, London, adopted a policy in 2010 restricting the clustering of hot food takeaways and banning them entirely from 400m exclusion zones around schools. In 2009, the Local Borough Council of Waltham Forest, London, developed a planning policy restricting the development of hot food takeaways in local centres, and excluding them completely from areas within a 10-minute walk from schools, parks or other youth centres. St Helens Council adopted a planning document in 2011, and Halton in 2012. In 2012, the City of Birmingham adopted a restriction on hot food takeaways to 10% of units in towns, districts and neighbourhood centres. Around nine of the local authorities have cited these planning policies when refusing planning applications by hot takeaways.

Some local policies (ie the New London Plan) have sought to encourage food retailers to adopt healthier catering schemes as part of granting planning permission (see above).
A University of Cambridge census of local policies in 2019 found one hundred and sixty-four (50.5%) local government areas had a policy specifically targeting takeaway food outlets; of these, 56 (34.1%) focused on health. The most common health-focused approach was describing exclusion zones around places for children and families (eg schools).
