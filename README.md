Datasets are created using the Data management script. Most datasets are loaded via API or R package. Any datasets that had to be manually downloaded are in the "Input Data" folder. 

Intermediate datasets created for each indicator or data source and final datasets for subsequent analysis are saved in the "Output Data" folder. 

All figures in the manuscript (including extended data and supplementary materials) can be replicated with the "FSCI_2024_Analysis" script and using the following datasets:
	# Supplementary data file 1: "Supplementary Data 1 - Metadata and Codebook.xlsx" - Provided for context, not necessary for replication

	# Supplementary data file 2: Full FSCI dataset, "FSCI_2024.rds"

	# Supplementary data file 3: Global expert elicitation results, lowest connection between each pair of indicators, "Interactions_ExpertElicit_LowestConnect.rds"

	# Supplementary data file 4: Global expert elicitation results, all direct connections, "Interactions_ExpertElicit_Direct.rds" (dataset in long form)

	# Supplementary data file 5: Global expert elicitation results, all direct connections, "Interactions_ExpertElicit_DirectMatrix.rds" (dataset in matrix)

	# Supplementary data file 6: Global expert elicitation results, all direct connections including bidirectional connections, "Interactions_ExpertElicit_Bidirect.rds"

	# Supplementary data file 7: Literature search results, after manual screening, "Search results_screened.xlsx"
