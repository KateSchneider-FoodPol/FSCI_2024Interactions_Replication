The Heart Sign Meal is a menu labelling scheme for healthy restaurant food. This scheme makes it easier for the diner to assemble a healthy meal and for the food maker to prepare healthy food. The subscriber of the food service, on the other hand, can use the Heart Sign to determine the best possible offer for its diners in the invitation to tender. The use of the heart badge in restaurants began in 2008.&nbsp;A heart sign is a sign found on food packaging and in restaurants that indicates that the product or food portion in question is a better option for health. The heart badge has been developed to make everyday life easier and faster. By choosing Heart Label products, you make small, health-friendly changes to your diet without having to read product descriptions or nutritional content.

A heart symbol system was introduced in 2000 by the Finnish Heart Foundation and the Finnish Diabetes Foundation. The heart symbol indicates that a product is a better choice regarding sodium and salt content compared with another product in the same food category. The heart symbol system is acknowledged by the Finnish national authorities, and the National Nutrition Council recommends consumers to use products bearing the heart symbol.

If the salt content exceeds the permitted salt content limit for certain foods important for salt intake, it must be indicated on the packaging by the words “high salt” or “high in salt”. The labelling of high salinity is determined by the amount of total salt in the food (both added and natural). The amount of sodium is converted to salt by multiplying it by 2.5 (for example, 400 mg of sodium = 1000 mg, ie 1 g of salt)

On 26 January 2016, the French Ministry of Health introduced Article 5 of the Health Act that recommended introducing a system of nutrition labelling. The Directorate-General for Health requested Public Health France to design the nutrition labelling and the decision to recommend the NutriScore system was informed by research that trialled four different types of nutrition labels in 80 supermarkets in September 2016. The NutriScore system was chosen as the most consumer-friendly. The NutriScore label uses a nutrient-profiling system, based on the UK Food Standards Agency model. It classifies food and drinks according to five categories of nutritional quality, indicated via a colour scale ranging from dark green to dark red. Each colour is also associated with a letter from A (dark green) to E (dark red) to make the labelling more accessible and understandable to consumers. The score takes into account for every 100 grams of produce whether the contents of the product include nutrients and food that should be favoured (positive nutrients including fibre, protein, fruit and vegetables) or nutrients that should be limited (negative nutrients including energy, saturated fatty acids, sugars, salt). The amount of nutrients per 100 grams contained in the product is scored using a points system (0–40 for negative nutrients and 0–15 for positive nutrients that should be favoured). The nutritional score of the product is calculated by subtracting the negative nutrient points from the positive nutrient points. All processed food is included, except aromatic herbs, teas, coffees and yeasts, and all beverages, except alcoholic beverages. The European Commission approved the use of the NutriScore label and on 31 October 2017 the French government signed a decree outlining that the NutriScore label would be used in France. The label is voluntary. The fourth National Health Nutrition Program plans to extend the use of the Nutri-Score to out-of-home catering and unpacked foods in the future.""

The EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the Provision of Food Information to Consumers (EU FIC) requires a nutrition declaration (list of the nutrient content) for most pre-packaged food to be provided on the back of the pack. The EU FIC is enforced in England by The Food Information Regulations of 2014 (a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs lead). Similar legislation applies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mandatory (“back of pack”) nutrition declaration applies to most prepacked food. It is mandatory to declare energy value in both kilojoules (kJ) and kilocalories (kcal); and the amounts in grams (g) of fat, saturates, carbohydrate, sugars, protein and salt. Exemptions are outlined in Annex V of EU FIC and included minimally processed foods and those with little nutritional value or that do not change the nutritional values of food products. The manufacturer can also choose to disclose the content of some other substances: mono-unsaturates; poly-unsaturates; polyols; starch; fibre; and selected vitamins or minerals provided they are present in """"substantial amounts"""", i.e., 15% of the reference value for foods, and 7.5% of the reference value for drinks.

It is a joint Australian, state and territory governments and New Zealand government initiative developed in collaboration with industry, public health and consumer groups. The HSR system takes into account four aspects of a food associated with increasing risk for chronic diseases; energy, saturated fat, sodium and total sugars content along with certain ""positive"" aspects of a food such as its content of fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and, in some instances, dietary fibre and protein. Star ratings range from ½ star (least healthy) to 5 stars (most healthy). Implementation is overseen by the Food Ministers' Meeting, the Food Regulation Standing Committee and the Health Star Rating Advisory Committee. The HSR system was independently reviewed in 2019, with an updated system implemented from 15 November 2020.

In March 2015, the Iranian government introduced a new version of the Food and Beverages labelling regulation that introduced a front of pack traffic light label. It displays individual information on the fat, sugar, salt, trans fatty acids and energy content of the product to improve consumer understanding. Green indicates low or a little amount of the corresponding nutritional risk factor, yellow indicates a moderate amount and red shows a high amount, with thresholds set for each colour. For example, the thresholds for salt quantity are green - less than 0.3g of salt&nbsp;per 100g of food, yellow - between 0.3g and 1.5g of salt per 100g of food, and red - more than 1g of salt&nbsp;per 100g of food. The label is mandatory for all industrial foods which are manufactured in, or imported into, Iran. The label is not mandatory for traditional foods and outlet foods. This advanced labelling protocol was implemented step by step over a period of 18 months, extended for another 12 months, and is now fully implemented.

On 1 January 2020, Israel introduced mandatory red warning labels&nbsp;for products high in saturated fat, sugar or salt. Maximum levels of salt, sugar and saturated fats are defined by the Ministry of Health specifically to apply to be applied to these red labels. Depending on their composition, foods and drinks can carry one, two, or three warning labels carrying these messages: high levels of sugar, high levels of salt, and/or high levels of saturated fat.&nbsp;Food and drinks manufacturers have been granted two deadlines by which to reformulate their products: 1 January 2020 and 1 January 2021. In the first stage, the following thresholds were set: 500mg of sodium, 13.5g of total sugars, and 5g of total saturated fats per 100g of solid food. Beyond these limits, solid foods will require a red label. For drinks (‘liquid food') these maximum limits are 400mg of sodium, 5g of total sugars, and 3g for total saturated fat per 100 ml. Starting with January 2021, both these sets of limits will be reduced, as follows: 400mg of sodium, 10g of total sugars, and 4g of total saturated fat for solid food; and 300mg of sodium, 5g of total sugars, and 3g of total saturated fat acid for drinks.

It is a joint Australian, state and territory governments and New Zealand government initiative developed in collaboration with industry, public health and consumer groups. The HSR system takes into account four aspects of a food associated with increasing risk for chronic diseases; energy, saturated fat, sodium and total sugars content along with certain ""positive"" aspects of a food such as its content of fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes, and, in some instances, dietary fibre and protein. Star ratings range from ½ star (least healthy) to 5 stars (most healthy).

&nbsp;

The Keyhole symbol has been used as a common Nordic labelling scheme on food products in Norway, Denmark and Sweden since 2009. Which food product groups that can be labelled with the Keyhole symbol and the criteria the products must meet, are determined by Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Icelandic authorities. Use of the logo is voluntary, but products must conform to the nutrition criteria, which are identical among participant countries of the programme. The aim of the Keyhole logo is to help consumers choose products that contain less fat, salt and sugar. The purpose of the scheme is also to stimulate the food industry to develop more products with less fat, healthier fatty acid composition, less salt and sugar as well as with more dietary fiber, whole grains, vegetables and fruits.

In Norway, the Directorate of Health and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority are responsible for the labelling scheme. Using the Keyhole symbol is voluntary, and it is the manufacturers’ responsibility to follow the set of criteria set by the authorities. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is responsible for monitoring compliance with the regulations regarding use of the label. New, stricter requirements came into force on 1 March 2015, with a transition period until 1 September 2016 for products adhering to the old requirements. Under the new requirements, Keyhole products will need to contain less salt, sugar and saturated fat, and more whole grains. For the first time, criteria were introduced for maximum salt content in meat and fish products. Foods marked with the Keyhole contain more fiber and whole grains and less fat and saturated fat, sugar and salt, compared to other foods of the same type without the Keyhole. Some foods also contain more vegetables, fruits and berries.

The keyhole can be found on the packaging of the foods. You can also find the label on bread, meat and cheese that is not wrapped. All fresh fish, fruits, berries, vegetables and potatoes are keyhole products, even though they are not labeled with the Keyhole.

EU Regulation No. 1169/2011 allows voluntary repetition on pre-packed food labels of those elements of the mandatory nutrition declaration that are of key importance for public health. Colour coding is an additional form of expression. &nbsp;In 2013, UK Ministers recommended the ‘multiple traffic light’. This label uses a colour coded system to provide simplified ‘at a glance’ information to help consumers determine if the prepacked food they are considering purchasing is high (red), medium (amber) or low (green) in fat, saturated fat, sugars and salt. If providing front of pack nutrition labelling, energy must be declared as kJ/kcal per 100g/mL as a minimum.

Front of pack nutrition labels, or labels that use interpretational aids such as colours and symbols can support healthy choices and may reduce obesity rates by communicating complex nutritional information to shoppers in a way that is easy to understand. This in turn may reduce dietary intakes of calories and nutrients, such as salt, saturated fat and sugar which, if overconsumed, have been linked to chronic disease and may also help consumers to control their calorie intake.
In 2012, following significant research on labelling schemes, the UK Government and Devolved Administrations consulted on how greater consistency and clarity on FOPNL might be achieved. In 2013 UK Health Ministers recommended the voluntary multiple traffic light label, a colour-coded system which shows at a glance whether a product is high (red) medium (amber) or low (green) in fat, saturated fat, salt and sugars, including the total energy (kilocalories and kilojoules) it provides.

Regulated food service premises include&nbsp;restaurants, quick-service restaurants, convenience stores, grocery stores, movie theatres, public-facing cafeterias, food trucks and others. “Standard food items” are restaurant-type food or drink items (eg ready-to-eat items) that are sold or offered for sale in servings that are standardised for portion and content. Menus include paper menus, menu boards, electronic menus, drive-through menus, online menus or menu applications, advertisements and promotional flyers. Food service premises must also display information on daily caloric requirements. Ontario’s 36 public health units are responsible for implementation of the Act. The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care developed an implementation guide, fact sheets and a frequently asked questions document to facilitate and streamline implementation.

In 2012, the Minister for Health called on all standard food service businesses to voluntarily display calories on food and drinks served in Ireland under the calorie menu labelling scheme as part of a multi-faceted approach to reduce the burden of overweight and obesity. To assist this, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) published a guide to ensure that the calorie information provided was useful for customers. This guide revolves around four core principles: 1) to provide calorie information on all standard food and drink items sold, 2) to have this information displayed clearly andprominently at the ‘point of choice’ for the consumer, 3) to display this information per portion or per meal and 4) to include information regarding average daily calorie needs so consumers can ‘make sense’ of calorie references on menus.

Based on the voluntary 2008 Guidelines on&nbsp;Advertisement and Nutrition Labelling for Fast Food Restaurants, Malaysian fast food restaurants are encouraged to display nutrient information on energy, carbohydrates, protein, fat and sodium for food and total sugar for beverages. Restaurants are free to decide how they display this information (eg&nbsp;on-pack labelling, brochures, posters in the outlet). Implementation of the Guidelines is not monitored but the Ministry of Health periodically engages with the fast food industry to urge companies to implement the Guidelines.

In October 2011, the (then) Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation endorsed a set of principles to facilitate national consistency if jurisdictions elect to introduce state or territory based legislation for the display of point-of-sale nutrition information in standard food outlets. Based on these national principles the following regulations are in place: The QLD Health Legislation Amendment Act 2016 in the Australian Capital Territory (amendments to Food Regulation 2002 in effect since February 2012) and the states of New South Wales (Food Regulation 2010, in effect since February 2011), South Australia (amendments to Food Regulation 2002 in effect since February 2012), Queensland (amendments to Food Act 2006, passed in March 2016, enforceable from March 2017) and Victoria (amendment to Food Act 1984 in effect since 1 May 2018) require restaurant chains (eg fast food chains, ice cream bars) with ≥20 outlets in the state (or seven in the case of ACT), or 50 or more across Australia, to display the kilojoule content of food products on their menu boards. The display must be clear and legible. Average adult daily energy intake of 8,700kJ must also be prominently featured. Other chains/food outlets are allowed to provide this information on a voluntary basis, but must follow the provisions of the legislation (except in Victoria where voluntary display need not comply with the legislation). Work is currently underway to consider approaches to achieve better national consistency in menu labelling across Australia.

In 2008, New York City was the first jurisdiction to require calorie labelling in chain restaurants. The calorie labelling rule within the NYC Health Code was updated in 2015, with enforcement as of 22 May 2017. All covered food service establishments must now include two new nutrition statements on menus and menu boards (“2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary” and “Additional nutritional information available upon request”), have comprehensive nutrition information on-site and provide it to anyone who requests it, and provide calorie information for multiple-serving standard menu items, combination meals with choices, self-service food, food on display, menu items with a choice of toppings and temporary menu items. This rule affects any establishment that requires a Health Department permit and is part of a chain with ≥15 locations in the US. The updated rule also covers chain food retail establishments that offer restaurant-type food.&nbsp;

Section 4205 of the&nbsp;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) created a new clause 403(q)(5)(H) in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (1938) which requires that all chain restaurants with 20 or more establishments display energy information on standard menu items. The implementing regulations were published by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 December 2014. Despite implementation being&nbsp;delayed several times, the regulation went into effect&nbsp;7 May 2018. Two states (California, Vermont), seven counties (eg King County, WA and Albany County, NY) and two municipalities (New York City, Philadelphia) have already implemented regulations requiring chain restaurants (often chains with more than a given number of outlets) to display calorie information on menus and display boards. These regulations will be pre-empted by the national law once implemented; local governments will still be able to enact menu labelling regulations for establishments not covered by national law (eg food trucks or restaurants not part of a chain which have not self-certified to voluntarily comply with the calorie labelling requirements). The regulations also require vending machine operators of more than 20 vending machines to post calories for food where the on-pack label is not visible to consumers. Implementation for vending machine operators is required by 26 July 2018.

Regulation 1924/2006 establishes EU-wide rules on the use of specified nutrition&nbsp;claims. A nutrition claim is any claim which states, suggests or implies that a food has particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the presence, absence, increased or reduced levels of energy or of a particular nutrient or other substance, and includes claims such as “source of calcium”, “low fat”, “high fibre” and “reduced salt”.&nbsp;The regulation entered into force in the EU in 2007. The body&nbsp;responsible with its implementation in the UK is the Foods Standards Agency (FSA). In England, responsibility for legislation on nutrition and health claims in England transferred from the FSA&nbsp;to the Department Health on 1 October 2010.&nbsp;

In theory, nutrition claims may only be used on food defined as ""healthy"" by a nutrient profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4 of the EU regulation states that nutritional profiles should be established before 2009 in order to lay down guidelines on which foods and / or food groups should be marketed with nutrition and health claims and which should not. This nutrient profiling restriction was due to be implemented in 2010 but no model has yet been established as of 2020.

In April 2015, Japan’s Consumer Affairs Agency (CAA), the governmental organisation charged with oversight of food labelling and health claims, introduced a new category of health claim labelling for food called “Food with Functional Claims” (FFC). The other two categories are “Food for Specialized Health Uses” (FOSHU) and “Food with Nutrient Functional Claims” (FNFC), introduced in 1991 and 2001 respectively. Food with Functional Claims (FFC) allows companies to display a product’s specific health benefit (aka “functionality”) and an associated area of the human body on retail food packaging. The FFC registration process is more affordable and faster than the registration process for Food for Specialized Health Uses (FOSHU), which requires clinical trials of a product and individual approval from the CAA. Guidelines exist for FFC labelling contents. FFC claims cannot be made for foods that lead to an excessive intake of fat, cholesterol, sugar and/or sodium. The CAA also revised its regulations for Food with Nutrient Functional Claims (FNFC) in April 2015 to increase product eligibility, expand the list of eligible nutrients, and to include fresh foods.

	Claims judged by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to have ""significant scientific agreement"" (currently 12 claims).
	Claims supported by a published, current and authoritative statement by a federal scientific body or the National Academy of Sciences (currently six claims).
	""Qualified claims"": these claims do not meet the above-mentioned standards but may be used if there is some scientific evidence to substantiate the claim provided they include a disclaimer referencing the scientific uncertainty. The FDA considers a number of factors in approving a claim, including the strength of the evidence and potential public health impact.


Health claims are generally not permitted if a food contains more than 13g of fat, 4g of saturated fat, 60mg of cholesterol, or 480mg of sodium. Sugar and whole grain content are not considered.

Companies may make nutrient function claims without notifying FDA, but such claims must be truthful and not misleading. Dietary guidance statements (eg, ""Doctors recommend 3 servings of whole grains per day"") are also permitted without FDA pre-approval but must be truthful and not misleading.

First introduced in 2004, the School Fruit Programme (Skolefrukt) allows all Norwegian primary schools to receive a fruit and vegetables subscription. In 2007, the Norwegian government introduced legislation requiring primary schools with lower secondary schools&nbsp;to offer one free piece of fruit or vegetables, five&nbsp;days a week, to pupils&nbsp;(grades 1–10). This was repealed in August 2014, when Skolefrukt became a subscription scheme for all&nbsp;primary schools.&nbsp;

All primary and lower secondary schools can participate in this version of the programme, which can be paid by&nbsp;either&nbsp;parents or by the&nbsp;school/municipality. In the case of a parent-paid scheme, a subscription is taken out for either 1⁄2 year or 1 year at a time. Students get a fresh fruit or vegetable every day (apple, pear, orange, banana, carrot, kiwi, nectarine or clementine, depending on the season). As of August 2020, the offer costs parents NOK 3.60 per day, and is subsidized by the government with NOK 1.50 per fruit / vegetable. Municipalities can offer free fruit / vegetables to their primary school students, covered by the municipal budget. With a municipally paid scheme, it is possible to order fruit / vegetables at the same price and state subsidy as for parents.

There are no national mandatory standards in Australia (see below for details of national voluntary guidelines). However, six states and territories have implemented mandatory standards, which are either based on the national voluntary guidelines or nutrient and food criteria defined by the state: Australian Capital Territory (2015), New South Wales (2011), Northern Territory (2009), Queensland (2007), South Australia (2008), and Western Australia (2014). All of these states and territories identify ""red category"" food, which is either completely banned in schools or heavily restricted (eg&nbsp;offered no more than one or two times per term).&nbsp;The ACT Public School Food and Drink Policy is mandatory for government primary and secondary schools, but not for independent or catholic schools.

Queensland’s Smart Choices&nbsp;school nutrition standards separate food&nbsp;and drinks into green, amber and red categories based on their energy, saturated fat, sugar, sodium and fibre content. Smart Choices ensures that “red” food&nbsp;and drinks are eliminated across the whole school environment.

In February 2014, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) announced the phasing out of sugary drinks for sale in school canteens by the end of 2014. The 2015 ACT School Food and Drink Policy prohibits the sale of sugary drinks in ACT public school canteens.

The requirements cover the food given for lunch, but not at school events or for sale in schools but the food for sale must support healthy eating.

This regulation also forbids to offer sugar-sweetened waters, however sugar-sweetened fruit based beverages are allowed. The Regulation establishes requirements for the catering of children and students younger than school age and the energy and nutrient content of food provided to children in children's institutions. When preparing the menu, the average daily food energy and nutrient needs of the age groups are taken as a basis. The food offered for school lunch, including school milk and school bread, must cover 30–35% of the daily food energy and nutrient needs of the respective age group.

It is recommended to cover 20-25% of the daily food energy and nutrient needs of the respective age group with the food offered as school meals. School meals do not replace school lunch. There are also voluntary guidelines for food sold in schools which recommend not to sell or offer any sugar-sweetened drinks in schools.

In 2017, the Finnish National Nutrition Council updated their nutrition recommendations for school meals replacing the recommendations from 2008. The updated recommendations are based on&nbsp;Health from food – Finnish nutrition guidelines&nbsp;(2014) and&nbsp;Eating together – food recommendations for families with children&nbsp;(2016).&nbsp;The recommendations provide a basic plate model for individual energy expenditure.&nbsp;Food and nutrient recommendations for salt, fibre, fat, starch, and fat content are outlined for all of the components of the basic plate model.&nbsp;

The recommendations state that drinks available at school meals should include fat-free milk/milk drinks and buttermilk, fortified with vitamin D. Other liquid dairy products and fermented milk products should be fat-free or low-fat products with a maximum fat content of 1%. Cheese products with a fat content of at most 17% and a maximum salt content of 1.2% should be selected. Fresh water should be available as the primary beverage&nbsp;at meals and must be available as the primary beverage to everybody during the whole school day. No soft drinks, energy drinks or any other acidified beverages or beverages with added sugar are served at school.

The school meals recommendation includes guidelines for organizing school meals, cooperating within the school and homes, along with monitoring and evaluating activities. Recommendations on the provision of school meals, snacks and their nutritional quality are given on a menu, food and nutrient-specific basis.

In 2009, legislation required products entitled to EU subsidies under the School Milk Scheme to meet nutritional criteria, including maximum levels of salt content. The criteria are set jointly by the Finnish National Nutrition Council and KELA, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. In August 2017, the legislation was amended so that only fat-free milk and fat-free sour cream are subsidised, and cheese was removed from the subsidy.

Decree No. 2011-1227 of 30 September 2011 (arising from Law No. 2010-874 of 27 July 2010 on the modernisation of agriculture and fisheries) regulates the nutritional quality of school meals in France, including the diversity and composition of meals, provision of water, portion sizes and restrictions on salt and sauces outside of prepared dishes. School canteen managers are required to keep record of menus for the previous three months at all times, including detailed information on food purchased from suppliers, and are required to identify clearly on menus seasonal ingredients in the composition of the meal. This follows from Interministerial Circular No. 2001-118 of 25 June 2001 which made recommendations on consuming a balanced diet in schools. These recommendations are currently being updated line with the guidelines of the National Nutrition and Health Program No. 4 2019 -2023 and the plan to fight obesity. The main nutritional goals outlined in these recommendations are to increase the intake of fruits and legumes, decrease fat intake, and rebalance the intake of fatty acids, and decrease the intake of added simple carbohydrates.(See ""S- Incentives and rules to restrict sugar- sweetened beverage consumption"").

Two German states have enshrined the&nbsp;voluntary guidelines on quality standards for school meals by the German Nutrition Society (DGE) in law: Berlin implemented the Law for quality improvements of school lunch meals&nbsp;in 2014 in all-day primary schools. The Law sets the DGE quality standards as a minimum requirement which schools have to adhere to, in addition to setting up a lunch meal committee that regularly conducts quality controls and supports the selection of appropriate food suppliers.

The state of Saarland requires all-day primary and secondary schools to provide school meals that are in line with DGE quality standards (Article 8 of the Regulation of all-day primary and secondary schools).

The DGE guidelines recommend that schools provide water and unsweetened herbal or fruit teas, and prohibit drinks that are high in sugar including juices and energy drinks. The guidelines contain a 20-day plan suggesting serving whole grains on at least four days and potato products a maximum of four days; salad, vegetables or legumes each day; fruit at least eight times; dairy products (ideally low-fat) at least eight times; fish at least four times and meat a&nbsp;maximum of eight times; rapeseed oil is the only permitted oil.&nbsp;

In 2024, the guidelines were updated to reflect that an environmentally friendly and healthy diet is ¾ plant based and ¼ animal based.&nbsp;

The recommendations are as follows:&nbsp;


	Beverages are the largest food group with a daily drinking amount of around 1.5 litres of water.
	5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day&nbsp;
	1 portion of legumes per week&nbsp;
	1 portion of nuts and seeds per day&nbsp;
	5 portions of grain, bread, or pasta per day, of which at least 1/3 should be wholegrain
	1 portion at 10g a day (preferably rapeseed, walnut, flaxseed, soy, or olive oil).
	A maximum of 300g of meat or sausage per week and 120g of Fish
	2 portions of dairy products per day and if plant based alternative are used instead, they should be fortified with B2 and iodine.&nbsp;


The recommendations apply to omnivorous, healthy adults - the next step will be to develop separate recommendations for children and adolescents, as well as people with vegetarian and vegan diets.

These standards were developed by the Center for Health Education and Diseases Prevention.

The implementation of this system started in 2019. According to it, children must always receive fresh, nutritious food prepared on the same day. Unhealthy foods and drinks, as defined by the Lithuanian food-based dietary guidelines, are prohibited. Every week, children’s meals are monitored by public health professionals working in schools. They are assisted by children and their parents involved in internal nutrition control, as there is an obligation to publish official child nutrition requirements and menus on the websites of educational institutions.

The Swedish school meal model offers free meals to all children in the ages 7-16, on a mandatory basis, and to most students aged 16-19, on a voluntary basis.&nbsp;The Swedish Education Act came into force 1 July 2011 requiring school meals to be nutritious and equal a third of the recommended daily intake of energy and nutrients for children up to the age of 19. Schools and municipalities are obliged to ensure that the food served is nutritious. The use of the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations to define ‘nutritious’ meals is not mandatory, but they are recommended as a point of reference. The provision of school meals is the responsibility of each municipality.

The National Food Agency was commissioned to work with the Swedish National Agency of Education by the Ministry of Education and Research to develop school food guidelines. The Good School Meals Guidelines, published in 2007 and revised in 2013, are for primary schools, secondary schools and youth recreation centres. The guidelines include age-specific reference values for energy and nutritional content in school lunches and portion sizes, and drinks are limited to water and milk. Ice cream, pastries and sweets are not provided by the school. The quality of school meals is monitored and assessed by an online tool (SkolmatSverige), and used by over three-quarters of schools in Sweden.

In May 2017, the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Health introduced a ban on the sale or serving of sugar-sweetened drinks at all government and government-assisted schools. Banned sweetened drinks include soft drinks, juice drinks, flavoured water, sports/energy drinks, tea and coffee, and milk-based drinks with added sugars and artificial sweeteners. Only water, 100% juice, low-fat milk and blended vegetable or fruit drinks can be sold at schools. The changes were introduced in a phased approach and all cafeterias and canteens needed to be in full compliance by September 2017.

The guidelines set out the requirements vendors must meet to obtain a licence to operate in public and private school canteens. Parents may provide their children with their own packed meals as long as they are in line with the canteen guidelines. The guidelines include calorie requirements for each grade, sample menus, a list of permissible and banned food&nbsp;by category, and nutrient-based standards (eg&nbsp;limits on total fat and sugar content; minimum amounts of macro and micro nutrients).

The Nutrition Requirements for food and drink in schools (Scotland) Regulations 2008 set high nutritional standards for all food and drinks served in schools. The first set of nutrient standards is designed to ensure that an average school lunch provides an appropriate amount of energy and nutrients for school age children and young people (different amounts for primary and secondary schools). The second set of food and drink standards apply to all other parts of the school day (including but not limited to breakfast clubs, after school clubs, tuckshops) and includes limitations on fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt content. The 2008 Regulations will be replaced by the Nutritional Requirements for food and drinks in schools (Scotland) Regulations 2020 on 8 April 2021. Key changes include: the school lunch nutritional requirements for energy and nutrients has been updated to reflect current dietary advice; increased access to fruit and vegetables; reduction in sugar content of school lunches; limitations on fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt content of a wider range of foods and drinks; provision of red and red processed meat brought into line with the recommendations set out in the dietary goals.

The Nutritional Standards for School Lunches and Other Food and Drinks in Schools were developed in 2007/08 to ensure that all food provided in grant‐aided schools reflects government guidance on healthy eating. Since the standards were introduced evidence and research has shown that we should eat more fruit, vegetables and dietary fibre whilst reducing the amount of sugar, salt, fat and processed meats. Government guidance on healthy eating, as outlined in the Food Standard’s Agency’s Eatwell Guide, has been updated to reflect this. Sugar sweetened beverages are not permitted within schools. The standards are compulsory in all grant‐aided nursery, primary and post‐primary schools, and apply to all free and paid lunches

Food Standards include&nbsp;
1)Confectionery, chocolate and chocolate coated products should not be available throughout the lunch time.
2) Cakes and biscuits can only be provided at lunch time and as part of a meal.
3) Cakes, biscuits and puddings made with cocoa powder should only be available a maximum of two days per week.
4) High fat and/or high sugar toppings used for decoration such as cream, buttercream and icing sugar should be kept to a minimum and only used if essential,&nbsp;

Drink standards inlcude: The only drinks available in school should be:
• plain water (still or sparkling);
• milk;
• unsweetened fruit or vegetable juices;
• yogurt or milk drinks (with less than 5% added sugar);
• drinks made from combinations of the above (eg smoothies);
• tea, coffee and low calorie hot chocolate* (these drinks are not suitable for the nursery sector).
2) Combination drinks must contain at least 50% milk, yogurt or fruit juice. Artificial sweeteners are only permitted in combination drinks.
3) Fresh drinking water, ie tap water, must be provided free every day.

Compliance with the School Food Standards is mandatory for all state-funded schools (including all academies and free schools). These school food standards are to ensure that food provided to pupils in school is nutritious and of high quality; to promote good nutritional health in all pupils; protect those who are nutritionally vulnerable and to promote good eating behaviour. The standards are organised by food group, specifically: starchy foods; fruit and vegetables; foods high in fat, sugar, and salt; and healthier drinks. The regulations apply to school lunches provided to registered pupils, whether on the school premises or not. They also apply to food and drink other than lunch, provided to pupils across the school day, including breakfast clubs, tuck shops, mid-morning break, vending machines and after-school clubs.

The US Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010 sets nutrition standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs which were implemented in July 2014 based on an interim final rule published in June 2013. A final rule on nutrition standards for all food&nbsp;sold in schools as required by the HHFKA was published in July 2016, introducing minor changes based on comments received on the interim final rule. The standards for total fat are retained as “interim” in the final rule and may be amended in the future. The Act also establishes guidelines for ""competitive food"" in the Smart Snacks in School Program. Standards include limits on the amount of fat, saturated fat, salt and added sugars permitted in food. Beverages are also restricted to water, low-fat or non-fat milk. Calorie-free carbonated beverages are permitted in high schools.

There are also many state-level rules in place. Some states, including California and Colorado, have restrictions specific to trans fats. For example, in 2008, California adopted Senate Bill No. 1498 which prohibited, as of 1 July 2009, elementary, middle and high schools from making artificial trans fats available through vending machines or school food service establishments during school hours and up to 1/2 hour before and after school hours. In Colorado, Senate Bill 12-086 (2012) prohibits a public school or institute charter school from making available to a student a food item that contains any amount of industrially produced trans fat.

States also have a range of different rules on ""à la carte lines""&nbsp;(ie&nbsp;food options that supplement the school lunch programme choices and stores inside schools).&nbsp;For example, Arizona, Rhode Island and Florida have bans on ""à la carte lines""&nbsp;in elementary schools. 17 other states have strict restrictions (eg&nbsp;specific lists of restricted food&nbsp;or nutritional criteria) that apply at ""à la carte lines""&nbsp;in elementary schools. 15 states have strict restrictions on food&nbsp;available at ""à la carte lines""&nbsp;in middle schools, while 11 states apply strict restrictions at high school level.

Arizona, District of Colombia, Florida and Texas have complete bans on school stores in elementary schools, and 13 states have strict restrictions on the food&nbsp;available in stores in elementary schools. 11 states have strict restrictions on the food&nbsp;available in school stores in middle schools, while eight states apply restrictions at high school level.

In 2011, Australia introduced the voluntary school food guidelines ""National Healthy School Canteens: guidelines for healthy food&nbsp;and drinks supplied in school canteens” (NHSCGs).&nbsp;The guidelines, updated in 2013,&nbsp;are based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines. The guidelines include three components: a national food categorisation system for school canteens, training materials for canteen staff and an evaluation toolkit. The food categorisation system uses a traffic light system to distinguish food categories that should be promoted and those that should be limited based on their nutritional value: red (not recommended), amber (select carefully) and green (always available). The guidelines provide examples of food&nbsp;within each category and additional nutrient criteria to assist the categorisation of food, mainly in the amber category. Food&nbsp;in the green category should be actively promoted. Food&nbsp;in the red category, such as sugar- and artificially sweetened drinks, food&nbsp;high in sugar, fat and/or salt and food containing excessive energy, should not be sold in school canteens. Implementation of the guidelines is at the discretion of each state or territory government.

The Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Northern Territory (NT) and Tasmania have implemented the national guidelines in full (ACT Public School Food and Drink Policy 2015, NT Canteen, Nutrition and Healthy Eating Guidelines 2013 and Tasmania School Canteen Handbook –&nbsp;a whole school approach to healthy eating 2014) while other states and territories have incorporated components of the guidelines within their own system:


	The Queensland “Smart Choices – Healthy food and Drink Supply Strategy 2004” closely reflects the Australian Dietary Guidelines and the NHSCGs.
	The “South Australia Right Bite, Easy Guide to Healthy Food and Drink Supply for South Australian Schools and Preschools” is based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and uses a traffic light food categorisation system similar to the NHSCGs. &nbsp;
	The Victorian “Go for Your Life – Victorian Health Canteen Policy – School Canteens and other school food services policy 2006” is largely consistent with the NHSCGs except for a few minor nutrient classifications introduced to reflect the evolving food supply. The policy also includes “School Confectionery Guidelines” which categorise confectionery and high sugar content soft drinks as BLACK. The Victorian Government funds the Healthy Eating Advisory Service to support schools to implement the canteen guidelines.
	The Western Australian “Healthy Food and Drink Policy 2014” is based on the Federation of Canteens in Schools nutrient criteria which has been recently revised to include traffic light coding in line with the NHSCGs.


New South Wales (NSW) has taken a different approach. The “NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy 2017” is based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and classifies food and drinks as either ""everyday"" (healthy) or ""occasional"" (less healthy). The strategy also uses the Health Star Rating (see ""N&nbsp;– Nutrition label standards and regulations on the use of claims and implied claims on food"") to guide users in selecting healthier versions of ""occasional"" packaged food.

The aim of the German Nutrition Society&nbsp;&nbsp;""Quality standard for catering in schools"" is to support those responsible for school catering in implementing a balanced lunch and snack menu that is tailored to the needs of children&nbsp;and adolescents and to enable them to eat adequately. Recommendations in these standards include providing products with a low percentage of sugar, fat and salts.&nbsp;The German Nutrition Society (DGE) has set voluntary guidelines on quality standards for school meals in Germany. The guidelines recommend that schools provide water and unsweetened herbal or fruit teas and prohibit drinks that&nbsp;are high in sugar including juices and energy drinks. The guidelines contain a 20-day plan suggesting serving whole grains on at least four&nbsp;days and potato products a maximum of four&nbsp;days; salad, vegetables or legumes each day; fruit at least eight times; dairy products (ideally low-fat) at least eight&nbsp;times; fish at least four&nbsp;times and meat&nbsp;a maximum of eight&nbsp;times; rapeseed oil is the only permitted oil. These standards are not mandatory.

In 2024, the DGE guidelines were updated to reflect that an environmentally friendly and healthy diet is ¾ plant based and ¼ animal based.&nbsp;
The recommendations are as follows:&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Beverages are the largest food group with a daily drinking amount of around 1.5 litres of water.
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 portion of legumes per week&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 portion of nuts and seeds per day&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5 portions of grain, bread, or pasta per day, of which at least 1/3 should be wholegrain

-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A maximum of 300g of meat or sausage per week and 120g of Fish
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 portions of dairy products per day and if plant based alternative are used instead, they should be fortified with B2 and iodine.&nbsp;

The Guidelines for Healthier Canteens were developed by the Netherlands Nutrition Centre (Voedingscentrum) in 2003, as part of the Healthy School Canteens Programme, under a commission from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports. Schools can voluntarily apply these guidelines to make their canteens and vending machines healthier with (small) changes. The guidelines focus on changing behaviour by adapting canteen environments and thus making healthy choices the easiest ones. This&nbsp;also includes encouraging&nbsp;drinking water.

Based on the changes they make to their food environments, schools can be awarded Silver, Gold or Ideal School Canteen Badges. A canteen is awarded a Silver Badge if at least 60% of their products follow to the Dutch dietary guidelines (the Wheel of Five). To receive a Gold Badge, 80% of products available in the school must meet nutritional criteria, and they must also be presented in an appealing way to students. Silver and Golden Badge Canteens thus give healthier products a leading role, without completely banning unhealthy choices. Schools in which only products from the Wheel of Five are available can receive an Ideal School Canteen Badge.

These guidelines are voluntary, but schools can get tailored free advice from a so–called Healthy Canteen Brigade, set up by the Netherlands Nutrition Centre in order to stimulate implementation.

The National Guideline for Food and Meals in Schools were published in 2015, as a revision of the Guidelines for the School Meal of 2003, but with more details and containing new recommendations. The guidelines are voluntary and include recommendations on the implementation of the meal (meal time, supervision, physical and social arrangements), the nutritional quality of the food and drink offered, food safety and hygiene, and environmental considerations. Specific recommendations are made for primary schools and the after-school programs; secondary schools; and high school. Separate guidelines for kindergartens were also published, which mirror the principles outlines above, but adapt them for younger children.

The guidelines recommend having a varied and mainly plant-based diet, with lots of vegetables, fruits and berries, whole grains and fish, and limited amounts of processed meat, red meat, salt, sugar and saturated fat. Some food and beverages categories should be limited, for example juices to maximum 250ml, completely excluding sweetened and caffeinated beverages, as well as chocolates, crisps and other snacks. Desserts and other products that are high in fat and sugar should be limited for special occasions. The guidelines also recommend limits for salt content: 3–4g&nbsp;per day for under 10s; and 5–6g&nbsp;per day for older students. Finally, the guidelines state that a healthy diet coincides with a more environmentally friendly diet which includes more plant-based food and fish and less meat, especially less red meat.

The programme provides cooked meals which are based on the South African Food Based Dietary Guidelines (2012). Cooked meals consist of a protein, carbohydrate and fresh vegetables or fruit on all school days. Protein used consist of once a week UHT milk or pasteurised maas, pilchards in tomato, soya mince, sugar beans, lentils or split peas. A new product, canned chicken livers are in the process of being introduced on the NSNP menu. The NSNP also promotes vegetable gardens to teach children to grow food and use the produce as part of the school meals.

The menus must also be developed to meet 35% of daily nutritional needs.

These standards&nbsp;are voluntary in nature, however, educational authorities usually consider them&nbsp;in the preparation of their technical prescriptions for public procurement of menus served in school canteens. Further&nbsp;these standards have been established as mandatory by some&nbsp;auronomous regions.&nbsp;

In 2008, the Thai Department of Health, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education’s Office of the Basic Education Commission (OBEC), announced a voluntary ban of soda and sugary packaged snacks in elementary and secondary schools under OBEC. It has been implemented by the majority of schools under OBEC.

The voluntary Thai School Lunch Programme was implemented in 1999, recommending schools to provide meals and snacks in line with the nutrient standards of the Thai Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) (last amended 2003). Three RDIs exist for different age groups: 3–5 years (1,200kcal), 6–12 years (1,550kcal) and 13–18 years (2,000kcal). School meals and snacks should make up 40% of the RDI, and recommend a distribution ratio of 55–60% carbohydrates, 10–15% protein and 25–30% fat. In addition, the RDIs set maximum levels of protein, fat, total carbohydrate&nbsp;and cholesterol, and contain recommended levels of vitamins (A, B1, B2, C), folate and calcium. The guidelines are intended to prevent both undernutrition and overweight/obesity. In 2013, the budget per lunch per pupil was increased from 13 Thai Baht (about US$0.4) to 20 Thai Baht (about US$0.6) to increase the quality of school lunches. Due to a lack of monitoring and evaluation capacity of the Ministries in charge of the programme (Ministry of Education, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Interior), it is unclear how widely the RDIs are implemented.

It is a joint Department of Education and Department of Health policy which applies to all grant-aided schools. The policy has elements that are mandatory for all schools such as the Nutritional Standards for School Lunches and elements which are strongly recommended but which ultimately schools have discretion to decide upon within their local context, in consultation with pupils, parents and others. From 2007 to 2011 The Education and Training Inspectorate’s Nutritional Associates were in place to monitor the implementation of the policy. No specific funding assigned as it is an overarching policy of existing policies/strategies however specific funding for the implementation of the Nutritional Standards element of the policy was provided until 2015.

In 2017, the NSW Ministry of Health published Healthy Food and Drink in New South Wales Health Facilities for Staff and Visitors Framework.&nbsp;

The framework aims to set best practice guidelines to provide healthy food and drink&nbsp;

The policy applies to all food and drink including packaged food and drinks including those prepared offsite. The policy extends to:&nbsp;
-cafes
- cafeterias
- kiosks and coffee carts
- vending machines
- convenience stores and newsagents
- other leased retail premises that sell foods or drinks, such as florists and pharmacies&nbsp;

Nourishing,"Offer healthy food and set standards in public institutions and other specific settings","Standards in other specific locations (eg health facilities workplace)","Government–endorsed guidelines for healthier food and drinks in health facilities

Governments in&nbsp;all&nbsp;Australian states and territories implement mandatory (ACT, WA, SA and NT) or voluntary government endorsed guidelines (NSW, Qld, Vic and Tas) to assist healthier food and drink choices in health facilities (and public sector workplaces in Tas and the ACT). Queensland Health was the first to adopt these guidelines in health facilities in 2007. In all jurisdictions, the guidelines are based on the National Health and Medical Research Council’s&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;Dietary Guidelines and Guide to Healthy Eating. Most use a traffic light system&nbsp;to distinguish food&nbsp;that should be promoted, and those that should be limited based on their nutritional value: red (limit), amber (choose carefully) and green (best choices). NSW classifies food and drinks as either ""everyday"" (healthy) or ""occasional"" (unhealthy). To varying degrees, the guidelines in each jurisdiction cover: the types of products available for sale through retail outlets and vending machines; product advertising and promotion; use of products for fundraising, rewards, incentives, prizes and giveaways; catering for meetings and events; and sponsorships. The most comprehensive guidelines make explicit that:


	green products must make up at least 50% of products for sale (ACT, Qld, Vic, WA, NT), ""everyday""&nbsp;food and drinks must make up at least 75% of the offering (NSW)
	red products (eg food&nbsp;and drinks high in sugar, fat and/or salt) cannot make up more than 20% of products for sale (ACT, Qld, Vic, WA, SA, NT), ""occasional"" food and drink cannot make up more than 25% of the offering (NSW)
	portion size limits apply to some ""everyday"" and all ""occasional"" food and drinks (NSW)
	only green products (ACT, Qld, WA, NT) and ""everyday"" food and drinks (NSW) can be promoted or advertised
	green products must be most prominently displayed (ACT, Qld, Vic, WA, SA, NT, Tas)
	prominent locations in a food outlet, value pricing and promotional activities only highlight ""everyday"" food and drinks (NSW)
	red products are not to be used for fundraising, incentives, rewards or giveaways (ACT, Qld, WA, Vic, SA, NT)
	catering should consist mostly of green products and not contain red products (ACT, Qld, Vic, WA, SA, Tas, NT)
	the government’s logo cannot be displayed alongside red or amber products (ACT, Vic)
	sugary drinks (drinks with any sugars added during processing, excluding milks drinks) are not to be sold (NSW – phased approach by December 2017)

In July 2016, the Brazilian Ministry of Health implemented procurement guidelines for any food served or sold for purchase in the Ministry and its entities (Ordinance No. 1.274 of 7 July 2016). The guidelines are based on the Food Guide for the Brazilian population. At least one seasonal fruit has to be offered, and sugar-sweetened juice, soft drinks or sweets cannot be sold or served. Ultraprocessed food may only be used in exceptional cases if it is used in meals which are prepared from mostly unprocessed or minimally processed food. Ultraprocessed food is defined by the Ordinance as food which is mainly produced from substances extracted from whole food and/or food components derived from materials synthesised from organic matter, and which contain ≥1mg of sodium per 1kcal, ≥10% of total energy from free sugars, ≥30% of total energy from total fat, ≥10% of total energy from saturated fat and ≥1% of total energy from trans fat (in alignment with PAHO’s Nutrient Profile Model).

In order to receive Healthy Cafeteria recognition, cafeterias need to display the energy content of food items, information on the Recommended Daily Nutrient Intake and a poster or food replica of one food serving containing less than 500 calories. They also have to provide smaller portion sizes for any food items/dishes exceeding 500 calories, sell at least one type of fresh fruit, plain water, and low-sugar drinks. They are not allowed to sell junk and processed food, sweets, premixed drinks, carbonated drinks and alcohol, as well as pickles preserved in salt, sugar and vinegar. The premises have to be smoke-free. In addition, cafeteria operators have to complete the Healthy Catering training (see ""G – Give nutrition education and skills""&nbsp;for more information).

The Policy was developed by the National Healthy Food &amp; Drinks Environments Network, an alliance of nutrition, dietetic, food service, and/or public health representatives from District Health Boards (DHBs, organisations responsible for providing or funding the provision of health services in their district) across New Zealand, and the Ministry of Health.

The Policy provides guidance on healthy food and drink principles and uses a colour-coded categorisation system to classify items as green, amber, or red based on nutrient criteria standards, ingredients, portion sizes, and/or level of processing. Green food and drinks are consistent with the healthy food and drink principles and are low in saturated fat, added sugar and added salt, and are mostly whole and less processed. Amber foods and drinks are not considered part of an everyday diet but may have some nutritional value. Red foods and drinks are of poor nutritional value and high in saturated fat, added sugar, and/or added salt.

Green items should predominate and make up at least 55% of food and drinks available for consumption, amber items should make up less than 45% of choices available, and red items (including deep-fried foods, confectionery, and sugar-sweetened cold beverages) are not permitted. Additionally, the Policy states that Green foods and drinks should be the most prominently displayed items by retailers and should be readily available in sufficient quantities, competitively priced, and promoted to encourage selection of these options.

In 2019, the National Program for the Promotion of Healthy Eating (PNPAS) developed a project entitled “Healthy Eating in Higher Education”, which makes a series of recommendations with regards to which healthful foods should be made&nbsp;available in their grounds.&nbsp;This includes ensuring that vending machines offer healthier foods and less sugar-sweetened beverages, that foods on offer in cafeterias contain less salt, include more varied vegetables and legumes, and bread that is higher in dietary fibre. The programme also offers a stamp of excellence for higher education institutions that opt to follow these recommendations (see ""S –&nbsp;Set incentives and rules to create a healthy retail and food service environment""). The stamp is aimed encouraging higher education institutions to implement strategies for the promotion of healthy eating. Institutions will receive this stamp if they implement a series of measures that ensure healthful foods are available in their grounds. To receive the stamp, institutions of higher education should also implement a communication campaign that promote healthy eating amongst the academic community.

The Healthy Menu requires the dish to be cooked using vegetable oil and providing protein (in the form of meat, nuts, or eggs), carbohydrates (rice or noodles), various vegetables and fresh fruit. To comply with the Fatless Belly Menu, the dish should not exceed 400kcal, 15g of fat, 2g of sugar and 600mg of sodium, and it should consist of 50% vegetables, 25% low-fat meat and 25% rice or a starchy carbohydrate.

In 2000, the Ministry of Public Health, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, introduced the voluntary Childcare Centre Standard. Childcare centres are encouraged to comply with nutrition guidelines for children aged 1–3 years and 4–5 years (last updated 2013); the latest survey, conducted in 2014, showed that 61.4% of childcare centres across Thailand met the Standard. The Standard prohibits sugar-sweetened beverages, meat high in fat, the use of salty seasonings (such as fish and soy sauce) and sugar in dishes, and snacks high in sugar and salt, including a ban to bring such snacks to the centres. They include recommendations on portion size for underweight, normal and overweight children as well as the frequency of food groups and meals. In addition, childcare centres have to comply with the Thai Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) (last amended 2003) for 3–5 year olds which are based on 1,200kcal/day and recommend a distribution ratio of 55–60% carbohydrates, 10–15% protein and 25–30% fat. The RDI sets maximum levels of protein, fat, total carbohydrate, and cholesterol, and contains recommended levels of vitamins (A, B1, B2, C), folate and calcium. The Standard and RDI are intended to prevent both undernutrition and overweight/obesity.

The 2012 update of the guidelines relaxed this requirement to 70% of drinks having to comply with the sugar limit of 0.5g per 100ml (but some hospital boards choose to retain the complete removal of sugary drinks), and mandated that vending machines must contain prominently positioned water, unsweetened fruit juice and/or low-fat milk. In addition, the guidelines require that at least 30% of snacks/confectioneries and 70% of refrigerated food in hospital vending machines meet the specified criteria of “healthier choices” which set limits on the permissible content of fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt/sodium.

TThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs developed the Government Buying Standards for Food and Catering Services (GBSF) (last updated in March 2015). These standards are mandatory for all central government departments and their agencies, as well as the National Health Service (NHS), prisons and the armed forces. Schools must follow the school food standards legislation but may also choose to use the GBSF too (see above). The wider public sector is encouraged to apply these standards, including to food and drink offered in vending machines (for example in leisure centres).

The GBSF include a set of minimum mandatory standards for inclusion in tender specifications and contract performance conditions, as well as best practice standards which are recommended, but not required. The mandatory nutrition standards include measures to reduce salt and saturated fat consumption, increase fruit and vegetable consumption, set minimum limits for fibre (more than 6g/100g) and maximum limits for sugar (22.5g/100g total sugars) in a proportion of breakfast cereals provided. Further, the standards set minimum limits for serving oily fish. For saturated fat, at least 50% of hard yellow cheese has a maximum total fat content of 25g/100g; at least 75% of ready meals must contain less than 6g saturated fat per portion; at least 75% of milk is reduced fat; and at least 75% of oils and spreads are based on unsaturated fats. Further, meat and meat products, biscuits, cakes and pastries (procured by volume) should be lower in saturated fat, where available.

For fruit and vegetable consumption, at least 50% of the volume of desserts available is based on fruit (fresh, canned in fruit juice, dried or frozen); a portion of fruit should be cheaper than a portion of hot or cold dessert; and meal deals should include a starchy carbohydrate, vegetables and 1 portion of fruit.The GBSF also include best practice standards.

These best practice standards apply to the following categories of food and drink:

– Snacks – Savoury snacks are only available in packet sizes of 30g or less.

– Confectionery

– Confectionery and packet sweet snacks are in the smallest standard single serve portion size available within the market and not to exceed 250kcal.

– Sugar Sweetened Beverages – All sugar sweetened beverages to be no more than 330ml pack size and no more than 20% of beverages (procured by volume) may be sugar sweetened. No less than 80% of beverages (procured by volume) may be low calorie/no added sugar beverages (including fruit juice and water)

Specifically, carbonated drinks containing 10% fruit juice, as well as lemonade containing more than 6% lemon juice would incur a value-added tax (VAT)&nbsp;of MAD10-15 (US$ 1-1.55) per 100L. Beverages below the juice threshold incur higher tax rates based on their sugar content: for 5g of sugar or less per 100ml, the VAT is&nbsp;MAD30 (US$3) per 100L; between 5 to 10g of sugar per 100ml, the VAT is&nbsp;MAD37.5 (US$3.88) per 100L; and beverages containing&nbsp;more than 10g of sugar per 100ml incur&nbsp;a tax of MAD 45(US$4.66) per 100L.

On August 31, 2020, the Act of February 14, 2020 amending certain acts in connection with the promotion of pro-health consumer choices was published (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1492), which entered into force on January 1, 2021.

The tax will be set at PLN 0.5 (EUR 0.11) in the case of a sugar content equal to or less than 5g in 100mL of the drink, with an additional fee of PLN 0.05 (EUR 0.01) per each gram of sugar above 5g/100mL.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, an additional fee applies to the introduction of beverages with the addition of:

• sugars that are monosaccharides or disaccharides and foodstuffs containing these substances and sweeteners referred to in the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC)

• caffeine or taurine.

The purpose of the introduced regulations was to use the fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthy consumer choices - to improve eating habits by limiting the consumption of sweet drinks. It is expected that the fee, as a tool used in counteracting civilization diseases, will change the consumption structure in the beverage category, which will result in savings for the health care system in the longer term (improvement in health indicators, reduction of overweight and obesity rates and diet-related diseases). The vast majority (96.5%) of the funds obtained from the so-called The sugar levy will go to the National Health Fund (NFZ), while the remaining part (3.5%) will be transferred to the state budget.

The expected revenues to the NHF budget in the first year of the fee being in force are about PLN 3 billion, which will be allocated to the implementation of educational and preventive activities as well as health care services related to maintaining and improving the health of beneficiaries with diseases developed due to improper health choices and behaviors , especially those who are overweight and obese.

Taxed beverages include sodas, sports drinks, sweetened teas and energy drinks. Exemptions include milk products, 100% juice, infant or baby formula, diet drinks or drinks taken for medical reasons. The Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Distribution Tax was approved by voters in the November 2016 election. “Distribution” includes the sale of beverages or sweeteners by one business to another (such as a sale from a wholesale business to a retail business) or the transfer of beverages or sweeteners from a wholesale unit of a business to one of its retail units. “Distribution” does not include retail sales to customers. The distribution of sugar-sweetened beverages will not be taxed more than once in the chain of commerce. Revenue from the tax will be deposited into the City’s general fund, and the City could use the revenue for any lawful governmental purpose. The tax will not apply to any distributor that is a small business. “Small Business” is defined as a business with less than $100,000 in yearly gross sales, if the business distributes sugar-sweetened beverages directly to consumers.

Launched on 1 April&nbsp;2011, Nutrition North Canada (NNC) is a government of Canada subsidy programme that helps provide northerners in isolated communities with improved access to perishable, nutritious food. NNC provides a retail-based subsidy that enables local retailers and registered suppliers to access and lower the cost of perishable healthy foods like meat, fish, eggs, milk and bread, as well as fruit and vegetables, all of which must be transported by air to these isolated communities. NNC also subsidises commercially processed country or traditional foods such as Arctic char, muskox, and caribou. NNC has two subsidy levels: level 1, which is the higher subsidy, is granted to foods that are deemed the most perishable and most nutritious; while level 2, the lower subsidy, is applied to other staple food items.

Eligibility is based on isolation factors and focuses on communities that lack year-round surface access (no permanent road, rail&nbsp;or marine access) requiring goods to be flown in. Effective 1 October&nbsp;2016, 121 northern communities had full access to the NNC subsidy. Four criteria inform subsidy rates, which vary across communities: 1) geographical distance from the supply centre to the isolated community, 2) distance flown, 3) population according to the census, and 4) minimum wage.

Residents in eligible communities can purchase subsidised food from registered northern retailers. Individuals, local restaurants&nbsp;and social institutions can also access the subsidy by ordering eligible items directly from registered suppliers. Retailers and suppliers are responsible for passing on the full subsidy to consumers and participate in regular compliance reviews as part of their agreement with the department of indigenous and northern affairs Canada. In order to increase programme transparency, on 1 April&nbsp;2016, NNC implemented a mandatory point-of-sale system allowing customers to clearly see the application of the NNC subsidy on their grocery receipts.

The Philly Food Bucks programme incentivises recipients of income assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, to purchase fresh produce. For every $5 spent using SNAP at a participating farmers’ market, shoppers receive $2 in Philly Food Bucks, which are redeemable for fresh produce. The Philly Food Bucks programme increases the purchasing power of low-income shoppers by 40% and increases access to fruit&nbsp;and vegetables. Between 2010 and 2016, over $350,000 worth of fresh fruit&nbsp;and vegetables have been purchased with Philly Food Bucks, and SNAP sales at participating farmers’ markets have increased by more than 300%. In 2015, with the support of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, local foundations and funding provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through its Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant programme, The Food Trust expanded the Philly Food Bucks initiative to other retail settings in the State of Pennsylvania, including supermarkets, corner stores, mobile markets, and additional farmers’ markets.

The Finnish Consumer Protection Act (1978, last updated 2016) regulates all marketing targeting consumers, including food marketing to children. The Consumer Ombudsman’s Guidelines: Children and Foodstuffs Marketing (2004, developed in cooperation with the National Public Health Institute and Finnish food safety authority) set out how to apply the Consumer Protection Act. These guidelines deal with the interpretation of guides published rather than provisions&nbsp;of the Food Act, but their interpretation is clarified in control guides published by the Food Agency.

The Guidelines specify that the purpose of food advertisements must be explicit, that the way of presenting cannot be misleading and that advertising practices should not encourage unhealthy dietary habits in children. They also advise to take special care when using marketing techniques with a special appeal to children. Neither the Consumer Protection Act nor the Guidelines define what unhealthy dietary habits and marketing techniques with a special appeal to children are. Whether food marketing to children violates these requirements is decided on a case-by-case basis by the Consumer Ombudsman and the Market Court (the court that hears marketing cases based on the Consumer Protection Act).

Considerations regarding the age-appropriateness of marketing are also made on a case-by-case basis, independent of the general definition of a child being a person under the age of 18 under Finnish law. The Guidelines, which are not legally binding, were developed taking into consideration the Market Court’s case law, and contain examples of cases where marketing was found to violate the Consumer Protection Act. Examples are competitions that a child can only participate in if the product is bought; using collectible toys; giving the impression that buying the advertised food will make the child more popular; and masking advertisement as a story. During the past decade, the Consumer Ombudsman has not had cause to take any case concerning food marketing to children to the Market Court, and has instead successfully collaborated with industry to align marketing practices with the Guidelines.

The Barbados School Nutrition policy targets all pre-school and school children aged 3-17 years old. The policy aims to help children in Barbados achieve optimal health, growth, and development so they can achieve their full potential whilst creating a healthy school environment. As of April 25, 2023 in schools in Barbados: beverages sold will be water, coconut water, 100% fruit juices, vegetable juices, low fat milk, plant-based milks. No drinks with added sugars or artificial sweeteners will be sold.

The policy covers a variety of areas such as:

1. Food Service environments which include the introduction of nutrition standards for all foods and beverages available in schools, restrictions on marketing and advertising in schools on food and beverages which are not consistent with nutrition standards and improvements in eating environments in schools. School children and parents will be included in the dissemination alongside training and educational programmes implemented.

2. Comprehensive nutrition education shall be a mandatory subject in the school curriculum from pre-school to secondary school. The integration of school food services and nutrition education will be integrated into the teaching of nutrition.

3. Supportive health and nutrition services shall be integrated to enhance learning and help in the prevention, timely identification, and treatment of overweight and obesity in addition to other health and nutrition related problems. Annual health and nutrition assessments of all school children (pre-school to tertiary) will be mandated. Knowledge and skills of primary health care providers in obesity prevention and management shall be upgraded to improve the delivery and quality of care.

4. Health promotion for the school community such as education and promotional activities shall be implemented to promote active participation of schools, parents, and the community to improve eating and activity behaviours of school children.

5. A school recognition programme shall be developed that stimulates schools to promote healthy eating and recognizes their efforts at improvement of their school environments in compliance with the provisions of the school nutrition policy.

In 2012, the Chilean government approved a Law of Nutritional Composition of Food and its Advertising (Ley 20.606). In June 2015, the Chilean authority approved the regulatory norms required for the law’s implementation (Diario Oficial No 41.193), which came into effect on 27 June 2016. The law restricts advertising directed to children under the age of 14 of food&nbsp;in the “high in” category, including TV programmes, internet, radio and magazines (see above). In addition, the regulatory norms ban the promotion, marketing&nbsp;or advertising of these products in pre-school, primary and secondary schools.

Advertising Act&nbsp;

Advertising in general is prohibited in the premises used by pre-school childcare institutions, basic schools, gymnasiums and vocational education institutions.Following the EU’s Audivisual Media Services Directive, Estonia updated the law by asking the Broadcasters to implement a self-regulation to limit the marketing of high fat, sugar, salt and trans fat foods to children. This self-regulation is implemented from 1st of Jan, 2023 and follows the WHO and EU co-created NPM. However, it only applies to audiovisual media and does not include digital marketing, direct marketing and campaigns in public spaces. Also, it only covers children up to 12 years old.&nbsp;
Additionally, the marketing law states that advertising can not take place on school territory (primary and secondary). Consumer Protection Agency has created a guideline to help follow the laws regarding marketing towards children, which means all marketing that is targeted towards children under 18 years of age. It adds that marketing towards children can not promote brand loyalty.

Based on Section 8 of Act XLVIII on Basic Requirements and Certain Restrictions of Commercial Advertising Activities (2008), Hungary prohibits all advertising in child welfare and child protection institutions, kindergartens, elementary schools and their dormitories. Advertisements promoting a “healthy lifestyle”, environmental protection or a cultural/educational event, are exempt from the ban. The term “healthy lifestyle” is not defined by Section 8, and school boards determine on a case-by-case basis if an advertisement complies with this exception, in addition to adhering to national regulatory mechanisms and EU regulations on health claims.

In February 2018, Ireland launched Voluntary Codes of Practice for non-broadcast media advertising and marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages, sponsorships by the food industry and food and beverage product placement in the retail sector. Non-broadcast media is defined as all forms of digital media, out of home media, print media and cinema. The overarching objective of the codes is to reduce exposure of the Irish population to marketing initiatives relating to foods that are high in fat, sugar and/or salt (HFSS foods) identified using the Nutrient Profile model used by the Broadcast Authority of Ireland. The codes were developed by a multi-sector group and sit alongside and complement other measures in place in Ireland, including the Advertising Standards Authority For Ireland (ASAI) Code of Standards for Advertising and Marketing Communications (see above - Mandatory regulation of broadcast food advertising to children and Mandatory regulation of specific marketing techniques).

For non-broadcast media, marketing communications for HFSS food and drink should not be booked on children’s media (defined by the Code as created specifically to be used and enjoyed by those under the age of 15 and/or those whose audience or user profile consists of 50% or more of this age group) and marketing communications carried outside of children’s Media which are targeted at children shall not include licensed characters and celebrities popular with children or use either promotions or competitions. In addition, displays of HFSS foods are restricted from 100 meters of schools and HFSS food sponsorship of sports pages or sports supplements is not allowed. Locations primarily used by children (e.g. registered creches, pre-schools, nurseries, family and child clinics, pediatric services, schools, dedicated school transport, playground and youth centers) are free from all forms of marketing communication for HFSS foods.

The Codes are voluntary in nature, and monitored by the Department of Health or its designated monitoring body, including an annual report for the Minister which covers effectiveness and complaints. Companies and partner organisations who sign up to the Codes are published in a register of signatories and are committed to comply with the rules agreed upon in the Codes of Practice.

A voluntary initiative was implemented in 2014 supplementing exiting laws in restricting marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children and adolescents (existing rules can be found under&nbsp;""Mandatory regulation of broadcast food advertising to children"" above). This self-regulatory scheme applies to a wide range of communications channels, such as online and in cinemas. It applies to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children under the age of 13. A code and supplementary guidance, and a product list of food and beverages (energy-dense, salty, sweet or nutrient-poor foods) are established that specify the scope of the scheme.

The Food and Drink Industry Professional Practices Committee (MFU) monitors compliance with the code and guidance, and handles complaints and violations. The MFU also gives pre-judgements on future campaigns. The MFU was established by industry. The Norwegian Directorate of Health represents the health authorities in the MFU. A website has been created which includes a complaints form, see: www.mfu.as. This ban also applies to advertising in cinemas in connection with films that are specifically aimed at children under the age of 13 (and which start before 18:30), interactive games specifically aimed at children and all types of competitions with an age limit lower than 13 years. However, marketing techniques such as packaging, shelf location and sponsorships have been excluded from the MFU definition of marketing ever since the scheme was introduced.

The MFU code is designed to protect against marketing aimed specifically at children under the age of 13. In terms of marketing aimed at young people, the self-regulation scheme states that the food and drink industry should exercise caution and consideration in respect of their age and development.

The code&nbsp;sets general guidelines for broadcast and online advertising&nbsp;and restricts product placement and use of celebrities in food advertising for signatories.

There are two enforcement mechanisms associated with the PAOS Code for broadcast media. First, copy advice carried out by the Asociación para la autorregulación de la comunicación comercial (AUTOCONTROL). Though this, proposed advertising directed at children is presented on a voluntary basis for control, prior to the broadcast of the advertisement on television. This prior consultation, which is confidential and binding, is mandatory for all companies that sign the PAOS code. Second, when a complaint or claim occurs, a post-hoc resolution process occurs, which is split between AUTCONTROL and an independent body called Jurado de la Publicidad. Ongoing monitoring of the implementation of these rules is carried out by a Monitoring Commission, whose members are government representatives, representatives of industry and representatives of a Consumers and Users Council.&nbsp;

The enforcement mechanism associated with the PAOS Code for online media is undertaken through the tools provided by the Institute Infoades and Comscore, which search and analyse content by brands that perform advertising aimed at children under 15 years. Ongoing monitoring of the implementation of these rules is carried out by a Monitoring Commission, whose members are government representatives, representatives of industry and representatives of a Consumers and Users Council.

The CAP Code applies to non-broadcast media just like BCAP to broadcast media, and the same nutrient profile model is used. It covers non-broadcast advertising (for example print, online), sales promotion and direct marketing (such as telesales and email). The code specifies standards for accuracy and honesty that businesses must stick to, including on advertising to children. Advertisements for high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) products must not be directed at people under 16 through the selection of media or the context in which they appear. No medium should be used to advertise HFSS products, if more than 25% of its audience is under 16 years of age. Additionally, where the content is likely to be seen as directly targeting under-12s, it cannot include promotions, or licensed characters or celebs popular with under-16s. These restrictions apply to ads that promote HFSS products directly and those that have the effect of promoting specific HFSS products through the use of ‘branding’ that is synonymous with a HFSS product or a range of products that is mainly HFSS.

The CAP Code is a self-regulatory system (unlike the BCAP&nbsp;which is co-regulatory). That means that&nbsp;the CAP Code&nbsp;is&nbsp;written and maintained by an industry committee, and the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) functions as an&nbsp;independent self–regulatory body responsible for administering the Code, whereby the advertising restrictions system is funded by industry. However, the Department of Health, Public Health England (PHE) and the Foods Standards Agency regularly dialogue with CAP. Thus, there is implicit government&nbsp;support of this self-regulatory scheme.

The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) oversees the government's voluntary reduction and wider reformulation programme, following its transfer in October 2021. It forms part of the commitments included in all chapters of the Childhood Obesity Plan (2016 &amp; 2018), Prevention Green Paper (2019) and Tackling Obesity policy paper (2020). The evidence setting out the need for the sugar reduction programme was published in October 2015 by Public Health England (PHE) in ‘Sugar reduction: the evidence for action’. The voluntary sugar reduction programme challenged all sectors of the food industry – retailers, manufacturers, and the eating out of home sector (for example, restaurants, pubs and cafes, takeaway and delivery) - to reduce sugar by 20% by 2020 in the categories of food that contribute most to the sugar intakes of children aged up to 18 years, including a 5% reduction in the first year of the programme.

In March 2017 PHE published guidelines for the total sugar content per 100g, and for the calorie content of products likely to be consumed on a single occasion, for the food categories included in the programme: biscuits; breakfast cereals; cakes; chocolate confectionery; ice cream, lollies and sorbets; morning goods (such as pastries and buns); puddings; sweet confectionery; sweet spreads and sauces; and yogurts and fromage frais. These were designed to help industry achieve the 20% reduction ambition. The reductions in sugar should also be accompanied by reductions in calories, no increase in saturated fat and achievement of salt targets, where possible (see below). Annual monitoring reports have beeen published, detailing industry progress towards the 20% reduction ambition. It also reports on changes in the drinks that are subject to the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) (see """"U – Health–related food taxes"""").

In May 2018 PHE published guidelines for every sector of the drinks industry to reduce the overall sugar content of juice based drinks by 5% and milk based drinks by 20% by 2021, with an interim ambition for milk based drinks of a 10% reduction by 2019. The sugar reduction achieved for juice based drinks and milk based drinks, where possible, are to be accompanied by calorie reduction (see below).

The voluntary calorie reduction programme challenges all sectors of the food industry – retailers, manufacturers, and the eating out of home sector (for example, restaurants, pubs and cafes, take away and delivery) - to reduce the calories in a range of everyday foods consumed by children aged up to 18 years by 2024. In September 2020, PHE published guidelines for the calories per 100g and calories in products and meals likely to be consumed on a single occasion for each category.

A 10% reduction ambition has been set for most categories covering only retailers and manufacturer branded products. For the eating out, takeaway and delivery sector, a 20% calorie reduction ambition is applied for most categories. The latest set of salt targets, published in 2020 by PHE and due to be delivered by businesses by 2024, (see below) should also be achieved in the products included within the calorie reduction programme, where relevant, therefore calorie reduction should not be accompanied by an increase in salt in these products.

In March 2014, the government introduced new salt reduction targets covering 76 categories of food to be met by 2017, along with new salt targets for the most popular meals consumed out of home. All major supermarkets and many big manufacturing and catering brands signed up to achieve these salt reduction targets, which replaced the original salt reduction pledge. The Responsibility Deal was operational during the coalition government from 2010 to 2015.

The initiative included mechanisms to monitor sodium in the food supply to track companies’ progress towards specific targets, and to monitor changes in people’s actual salt intake. To maintain momentum, the New York City Board of Health approved the sodium warning rule in 2015 (see “N – Nutrition label standards and regulations on the use of claims and implied claims on food""). In June 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced draft voluntary sodium reduction targets, which were partly informed by the design of the National Salt Reduction Initiative.

More information on state-based initiatives can be found at the Healthy Food Access Portal weblink below.

There are also initiatives at the city level. For example, in 2008, New York City made 1,000 licences for Green Carts available (through Local Law 9). Green Cart licences were issued to street vendors who exclusively sell fresh fruit and vegetables in neighbourhoods with limited access to healthy food.

Under the programme, financial and zoning incentives are offered to promote neighbourhood grocery stores offering fresh meat, fruit and vegetables in under-served communities. The financial benefits consist of an exemption or reduction of certain taxes. The zoning incentives consist of providing additional floor area in mixed buildings, reducing the amount of required parking, and permitting larger grocery stores as-of-right in light manufacturing districts.

New York City initiated Shop Healthy NYC in 2005 (formerly called Healthy Bodegas). The aim of Shop Healthy NYC is to work with communities – including residents, food retailers, and food suppliers and distributors – to increase access to healthy food. Shop Healthy NYC’s main focus is on neighbourhoods with high rates of obesity and limited access to nutritious food. In the initiative, Department of Health staff work with shop owners to sell more low-fat milk, low-salt and no-sugar-added canned goods, and to improve the quantity, quality and display of fresh food. The initiative targets both supply and demand by helping retailers to stock and promote healthy food, and by collaborating with distributors and suppliers to facilitate wholesale purchases. It also engages communities by encouraging New Yorkers to adopt a shop in their neighbourhood. The Department of Health issued a guideline, How to Adopt a Shop,&nbsp;in 2013 as a guide to communities working with local retailers.

In March 2009, the Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport of British Columbia passed the Public Health Impediments (BC Trans Fat) Regulation, effective since September 2009. Under the Regulation, food service establishments are not permitted to use margarines and oils with a trans fat content exceeding 2%, and other food&nbsp;with a trans fat content of above 5%. Food&nbsp;exempt from the restriction are pre-packaged food products with a nutrition facts table required under the Canadian Food and Drugs Act that are sold or offered directly to the consumer without any alteration to the nutritional contents, and food&nbsp;that&nbsp;only contains naturally occurring trans fats.&nbsp;Food service establishments must also keep documentation on site on the trans fat content of the food they use. In case of violations, operators can be fined CAD$230 for exceeding the prescribed trans fat content and CAD$115 for failing to provide adequate documentation upon request. Food service establishments are defined in the Food Premises Regulation (BC&nbsp;Reg. 210/99) as premises on which food is processed, served, and consumed immediately (Article 1.1).

The national ban of partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of trans fats (see ""I – Improve nutritional quality of the whole food supply""), does not preempt&nbsp;local regulations as long as they are not in conflict with the FDA’s ban. However, preemption has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;

In 2006, New York City’s Health Code was amended to restrict the amount of trans fats allowed in food served by all food service establishments required to hold a licence from the New York City Health Department, including restaurants, bakeries, cafeterias, senior-meal programmes, mobile food vendors, soup kitchens, concession stands and others. The maximum amount of trans fat allowed per serving is 0.5g. Violators are subject to fines of $200 to $2,000.

A range of other US cities and counties have followed suit and banned restaurants from serving trans fats.

In March 2008, the Boston Public&nbsp;Health&nbsp;Commission's Board of Health passed the Artificial&nbsp;Trans Fat&nbsp;Regulation, which prohibits food service&nbsp;establishments in Boston to store,&nbsp;prepare,&nbsp;distribute, hold for service or serve any food or&nbsp;beverage&nbsp;containing artificial trans fat. Food items&nbsp;and beverages are exempt from the&nbsp;Regulation if&nbsp;they contain less than 0.5g&nbsp;of trans fat per&nbsp;serving, or&nbsp;if they are served in a manufacturer’s&nbsp;original, sealed package containing a&nbsp;nutrition label&nbsp;required by federal or state law (eg&nbsp;crackers or&nbsp;potato&nbsp;chips).&nbsp;Food service establishments&nbsp;are&nbsp;defined as establishments that are required to hold a&nbsp;permit from&nbsp;Boston’s Inspectional Services&nbsp;Department (ISD), including restaurants, grocery and&nbsp;convenience stores, delis, cafeterias in businesses&nbsp;and public and private&nbsp;schools, bakeries and mobile&nbsp;food vendors. The Regulation was implemented in a collaboration between the Office of Environmental Health, the Chronic Disease Division and ISD, and food service establishments had to&nbsp;fully comply with the Regulation by March 2009.&nbsp;Violations of the Regulation&nbsp;are fined from $100 for&nbsp;the first offence to $1,000 for three or more&nbsp;violations&nbsp;within a 24-month period.

Law No&nbsp;120 of 13 September 2007 in the US territory of Puerto Rico bans artificial trans fat in food establishments (restaurants, home delivery services, mobile units), except when food is served directly to the clients in the original package seal of the manufacturer. It also includes school canteens, day care centres and homes for the elderly. Violations are subject to a fine.

Assembly Bill 97 of 25 July 2008 amends California’s Health and Safety Code to require all food facilities (restaurants) in the state, with the exception of public school cafeterias, to cease using artificial trans fats by January 2011. Packaged food&nbsp;in a manufacturer’s sealed, original packaging is exempt. Violation of the law is punishable by a fine ranging from $25&nbsp;to $1,000.

Some US states also have provisions restricting the availability of trans fats in schools (see ""O – Offer healthy food&nbsp;and set standards in public institutions and other specific settings"").

In 2012, the Philadelphia Healthy Chinese Take-Out Initiative was established in partnership with Temple University’s Center for Asian Health, the Asian Community Health Coalition, the Greater Philadelphia Chinese Restaurant Association and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. The aim of the initiative is to reduce the sodium content of dishes and to promote awareness of the impact of sodium consumption on health.

Dishes from Chinese take-out restaurants contain large amounts of sodium, mainly due to the sauces used in preparation and cooking. In Philadelphia, there are approximately 400 Chinese take-out restaurants clustered in low-income and high-risk communities. As part of the initiative, restaurant owners and chefs received support and training on reducing sodium in their menu (see ""G – Give nutrition education and skills""). Common sodium reduction strategies implemented by the restaurant staff included enhancing flavours with herbs and spices, using less sauce and switching to lower sodium ingredients. The programme helped decrease sodium levels in the three most common dishes served by 181 Chinese take-out restaurants by about 30% over 36 months in 2015. This successful model is now being replicated in Chinese buffet restaurants in Philadelphia.

The National Planning Policy Framework sets out that planning policies and decisions should aim to achieve healthy, inclusive and safe places which enable and support healthy lifestyles, including through access to healthier food. National planning guidance enable local authorities to limit the opening of new hot food takeaways close to schools and in areas of over-concentration and high obesity rates where supported by evidence. Local planning policies and guidance to control the over-concentration and proliferation of hot food takeaways should form part of a local authority-wide approach for tackling obesity and should involve a range of different departments and stakeholders.Around 15 local authorities in the UK have developed supplementary planning documents on the development of hot food takeaways.

The policies typically exclude hot food takeways from a 400m zone around the target location (eg primary schools). For example, Barking and Dagenham’s Local Borough Council, London, adopted a policy in 2010 restricting the clustering of hot food takeaways and banning them entirely from 400m exclusion zones around schools. In 2009, the Local Borough Council of Waltham Forest, London, developed a planning policy restricting the development of hot food takeaways in local centres, and excluding them completely from areas within a 10-minute walk from schools, parks or other youth centres. St Helens Council adopted a planning document in 2011, and Halton in 2012. In 2012, the City of Birmingham adopted a restriction on hot food takeaways to 10% of units in towns, districts and neighbourhood centres. Around nine of the local authorities have cited these planning policies when refusing planning applications by hot takeaways.

Some local policies (ie the New London Plan) have sought to encourage food retailers to adopt healthier catering schemes as part of granting planning permission (see above).
A University of Cambridge census of local policies in 2019 found one hundred and sixty-four (50.5%) local government areas had a policy specifically targeting takeaway food outlets; of these, 56 (34.1%) focused on health. The most common health-focused approach was describing exclusion zones around places for children and families (eg schools).

The guidelines also apply to independent companies contracted to provide food services on the premises of the Ministry and its entities. The Ordinance aims to address overweight, obesity and non-communicable diseases, and is based on the right to adequate food. The guidelines are based on the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population, and state that only unprocessed and minimally processed food may be procured. The purchase of processed food (eg canned food, fruit compote, candied fruit, salt-preserved meats) should be minimised, and food from organic and agroecological production preferred whenever possible. Ultraprocessed food may only be used in exceptional cases if it is used in meals which are prepared from mostly unprocessed or minimally processed food. Ultraprocessed food and beverages that are not used for meal preparation may not be purchased (eg soft drinks, sugar-sweetened fruit juices, industrialised sweets). Ultraprocessed food is defined by the Ordinance as food which is mainly produced from substances extracted from whole food and/or food components derived from materials synthesised from organic matter, and which contains ≥1mg of sodium per 1kcal, ≥10% of total energy from free sugars, ≥30% of total energy from total fat, ≥10% of total energy from saturated fat and ≥1% of total energy from trans fat (in alignment with PAHO’s Nutrient Profile Model).

These standards are mandatory for all central government departments and their agencies, as well as the National Health Service (NHS), prisons and the armed forces. Schools must follow the school food standards legislation but may also choose to use the GBSF too (see above). The wider public sector is encouraged to apply these standards, including to food and drink offered in vending machines (for example in leisure centres).

The GBSF include a set of minimum mandatory standards for inclusion in tender specifications and contract performance conditions, as well as best practice standards which are recommended, but not required. The mandatory nutrition standards include measures to reduce salt and saturated fat consumption, increase fruit and vegetable consumption, set minimum limits for fibre (more than 6g/100g) and maximum limits for sugar (22.5g/100g total sugars) in a proportion of breakfast cereals provided. Further, the standards set minimum limits for serving oily fish. For saturated fat, at least 50% of hard yellow cheese has a maximum total fat content of 25g/100g; at least 75% of ready meals must contain less than 6g saturated fat per portion; at least 75% of milk is reduced fat; and at least 75% of oils and spreads are based on unsaturated fats.

Further, meat and meat products, biscuits, cakes and pastries (procured by volume) should be lower in saturated fat, where available. For fruit and vegetable consumption, at least 50% of the volume of desserts available is based on fruit (fresh, canned in fruit juice, dried or frozen); a portion of fruit should be cheaper than a portion of hot or cold dessert; and meal deals should include a starchy carbohydrate, vegetables and 1 portion of fruit.The GBSF also include best practice standards. These best practice standards apply to the following categories of food and drink:– Snacks – Savoury snacks are only available in packet sizes of 30g or less.– Confectionery – Confectionery and packet sweet snacks are in the smallest standard single serve portion size available within the market and not to exceed 250kcal.– Sugar Sweetened Beverages – All sugar sweetened beverages to be no more than 330ml pack size and no more than 20% of beverages (procured by volume) may be sugar sweetened. No less than 80% of beverages (procured by volume) may be low calorie/no added sugar beverages (including fruit juice and water)– Calorie and allergen labelling – Menus (for food and beverages) include calorie and allergen labelling.– Menu analysis – Menu cycles are analysed to meet stated nutrient based standards relevant to the major population subgroup of the catering provision.

The Standards contain a ban on trans fat and deep-frying, and maximum levels of sodium in food&nbsp;and calories in&nbsp;beverages. They are applicable to food served to agencies’ clients and patients (ie&nbsp;hospitals, prisons, childcare services). Food served for sale, and to agencies’ employees, is excluded.

New York City (Executive Order 122 of 2008, revised in 2014) and Santa Clara County (Nutrition Standards, passed 28 February 2011 and effective since 1 July 2012) have also established nutrition standards for all food&nbsp;purchased and served by public entities. The standards are based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Los Angeles County has used health impact assessments relating to healthy food to inform public procurement bid specifications.

In 2013, a multi-sector State Food Procurement Work Group (formed by the California Health in All Policies Task Force) developed nutritional guidelines for food procurement in adult correctional facilities. The guidelines are aligned with federal nutritional standards, and include specific targets and recommendations for fruits, vegetables, cereals and grains, bread, dairy products, protein foods and beverages served. Since 2014, these voluntary nutritional guidelines have been systematically applied to food contracts as they have come up for renewal.

In Brazil, a 2009 law (Ley 11.947/2009 Regulamento de Programa Nacional de Alimentação Escolar) requires that 30% of the national budget for food served in the school meals programme must be spent on food&nbsp;from family farms, with priority given to food&nbsp;produced using agroecological methods.

The Food Acquisition Programme (Programa de Aquisicao de Alimentos) allows states, municipalities and federal agencies to buy food from family farms through a simplified public procurement procedure. The programme thereby encourages the purchase of perishable food&nbsp;and minimally processed food&nbsp;and makes them available to public institutions (eg&nbsp;hospitals, social assistance agencies, schools).

The Brazilian Institute of Horticulture and the Brazilian Central Food Supply Association are responsible for the promotion, regulation and organisation of food sales in the country. The Brazilian Market Modernisation Programme (Programa Brasileiro de Modernização do Mercado Hortigranjeiro) supports states and municipalities to modernise and adapt the supply of food&nbsp;to meet local needs. For example, supply centres (CEASAs) initiated the campaign Encouraging Intake of Fruit&nbsp;and Vegetables in the Central Food Supply. The first phase focuses on internal CEASA stakeholders (dealers, licensees and producers) and aims to increase the availability of fruit&nbsp;and vegetables. The second phase will target external audiences in the form of consumer information and promotion of healthy eating.

Based on the Environment Act of 2019, expected to enter into force in 2022, the Dutch national government mandates that municipalities must include health in both their environmental vision and their environmental planning (which includes infrastructure planning). This includes rules related to food supply (for example for the Healthy Food Canteens Programme) and aiming to encourage urban agriculture. In 2020, as part of preparations to the implementation of the Environment Act, the Board of Directors of Public Health and management of Municipal and Regional Health Services (GGD GHOR Nederland) adopted the Core Values of a Healthy Living Environment (2020), which provide tools for entering into dialogue with municipalities and other stakeholders about a Healthy Living Environment.

Since 2016, eight&nbsp;local authority councils in England&nbsp;have signed the voluntary Local Authority Declaration on Healthy Weight (HWD), developed and advocated by Food Active. The declaration contains 14 commitments, which can be adapted by local authorities to align policies across different council departments to promote healthy weights. Aside from the public health department, the declaration recommends involving departments from leisure services, planning and environmental health. Commitments include increasing the availability and affordability of healthy food and drinks in public buildings and facilities, engaging with the local food and drink sector to consider healthy retailing, increasing access to fresh drinking water on local authority controlled sites, protecting children from inappropriate food and drink marketing at events on local authority controlled sites, ensuring healthy eating messages are comprehensive and coherent with government guidelines, and considering how town planning can contribute positively to physical activity. Local councils are putting these commitments into action.

Target group: all adults, parents of adolescents, pregnant women, children 0-3 years (2019) The guidelines were developed by a multi-sectoral committee made up of representatives from different ministries, national health agencies, public research institutes and other relevant groups. The preliminary guides are subjected to an extensive consultation process with a variety of stakeholders and actors. The guidelines are part of the National Nutrition Policy. The guide for the general public provides recommendations based on the objectives of the PNNS, citing:

• Increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables, regardless of their forms (raw, cooked, natural, prepared, fresh, frozen or canned), to achieve at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day.

• Consume foods that are rich in calcium (mainly dairy products, in addition to vegetables and mineral water rich in calcium, for those who consume mineral water).

• Limit the consumption of total fat and particularly of saturated fat; these are provided by certain foods which are best consumed in moderation (pastries, meats, butter, sauces and certain cheeses). • Increase the consumption of starchy foods, including cereals (especially whole grain cereals, which provide fiber), potatoes, pulses, etc. They should be present at each meal.

• Eat meat, fish, other seafood and eggs alternating 1 or 2 times per day, giving preference to leaner meat cuts and fish (at least twice a week)

• Limit the consumption of sugar and foods high in sugar (soft drinks, candies, chocolate, pastries, desserts, etc).

• Limit the consumption of alcoholic drinks, which should not exceed 2 glasses (10 cl) of wine for women and 3 for men per day (2 glasses of wine of 10 cl are equal to 2 pints of beer or 6 cl of spirits).

• Limit the consumption of salt and always prefer iodized salt; enjoy the benefits of sunlight in moderation; and monitor your weight regularly. The new nutrition guidelines have been published for adults in 2019 and children 0-3 years in 2021. Updated guidelines for the other populations (pregnant women, elderly people and children 4-17 ans) are currently under revision.

In 2013, Germany published 'Ten guidelines for wholesome eating and drinking from the German Nutrition Society' intended for the general healthy population. Germany uses the nutrition circle as its food guide. The nutrition circle is divided into six food groups: cereals and potatoes; vegetables; fruits; milk and dairy products; meat, sausages, fish and eggs; and fats and oils. The size of the group segments decreases from the first to the last group, thus illustrating the relative quantities of the individual food groups. A seventh group (water and beverages), represented by a glass of water, is placed in the middle of the nutrition circle.&nbsp;

The German Nutrition Society has also developed a Food Pyramid as a pictoral model to present its nutritional recommendations. The basis of the pyramid is the nutrition circle, and traffic light colours are used to provide orientation to food choices.&nbsp;

In 2024, the guidelines were updated to reflect that an environmentally friendly and healthy diet is ¾ plant based and ¼ animal based.&nbsp;
The recommendations are as follows:&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Beverages are the largest food group with a daily drinking amount of around 1.5 litres of water.
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 portion of legumes per week&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 portion of nuts and seeds per day&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5 portions of grain, bread, or pasta per day, of which at least 1/3 should be wholegrain
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 portion at 10g a day (preferably rapeseed, walnut, flaxseed, soy, or olive oil).
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A maximum of 300g of meat or sausage per week and 120g of Fish
-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 portions of dairy products per day and if plant based alternative are used instead, they should be fortified with B2 and iodine.&nbsp;

The pyramid also includes images of physical activity and the recommendation to drink wine in moderation.

The food-based dietary guidelines were updated in 2014, by a non-profit organization (Prolepsis), under a commission by the Ministry of Health, which convened a Scientific Committee constituted by representatives from academia, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education and Culture. The new guidelines were adopted by the Ministry of Health in 2017, and they are valid until now.

The guidelines are divided into 4 different groups according to population’s age group, namely a) Infants, Children and Adolescents, b) Adults, c) Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women, and d) Persons over 65y. The guidelines are in line with the traditional Mediterranean diet, and apart of the Mediterranean pyramid, an illustration of “The Ten Steps to Healthy Eating” is used for the different categories.

Fruits and vegetables and breads, cereals and potatoes cover more than half of the circle. Animal source foods, spreads and cooking fats comprise a much smaller part. Water and other beverages such as tea, and coffee complete the circle. The recommended dietary patterns were summarised in seven general recommendations (e.g., eat lots of fruit and vegetables). These main recommendations are supplemented by advice regarding moderate consumption and choosing products based on their sustainability.

The Wheel of Five is accompanied by educational materials for all ages or targeted at specific ages. Further, a series of online tools targeted at individuals were also developed. These include:

The following energy distribution pattern is recommended: 25–40% fat; 10–20% protein; 45–60% carbohydrates. The intake of added sugar should be below 10% of the energy intake and the recommended intake of dietary fibre 25-35 grams per day. The intake of saturated fatty acids should be below 10% of the energy intake. It is recommended to choose low-fat dairy and dairy products, lean meats and meat products, as well as to choose edible oils, liquid margarine and soft margarine spreads instead of hard margarines and butter. The dietary content of polyunsaturated fat should be 5–10% of energy intake, including omega-3 fatty acids from fish. It is recommended to enjoy a varied diet with lots of vegetables, fruit and berries, whole-grain foods and fish, and limited amounts of processed meat, red meat, salt and sugar.

- Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day

- Base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other higher fibre starchy carbohydrates

- Have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks); choosing lower fat and lower sugar options

- Eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins (including 2 portions of fish every week, one of which should be oily)

- Choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat in small amounts

- Drink 6-8 cups/glasses of fluid a day

- If consuming foods and drinks high in fat, salt or sugar have these less often and in small amounts.

The Eatwell Guide applies to most people regardless of weight, dietary restrictions/ preferences or ethnic origin. However, it does not apply to children under 2 because they have different nutritional needs. Between the ages of 2 and 5, children should gradually move to eating the same foods as the rest of the family, in the proportions shown on the Eatwell Guide.

In the month of June 2015, the New York City Department of Health ran an ad campaign highlighting the health risks of children consuming sugary drinks. The ads explain that though a child may not be overweight or obese, sugary drinks can lead to increased visceral fat, which increases the risk of several diseases. Parents are encouraged in the ads to choose water or fruit for their children instead of sugary drinks.

The #LiveSugarFreed campaign&nbsp;ran for 15 weeks from September 2015 to January 2016 warning people about the health risks of sugary drinks.

The campaign included ads and messages across multiple channels including TV, internet and social media with a core image of a man holding a bottle of soda in one hand and a pack of cigarettes in the other, comparing the health risks of sugary drinks to cigarettes, citing heart disease, cancer and tooth loss. The campaign was supported by a website (livesugarfreed.org) that included ads, factsheets and ways for organisations to participate.&nbsp;The campaign also asked local businesses and organisations to adopt #LiveSugarFreed pledges. Gold, silver and bronze designations were awarded to organizations who promoted water instead of sugar drinks: Bronze – if water was made available wherever other beverages were available;&nbsp;Silver – if active steps to discourage sugary drink consumption were taken; and Gold – if sales or distributions of sugary drinks were stopped.&nbsp;

Following the publication of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition report on Salt and Health (2003),&nbsp;the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Department of Health committed to a programme encouraging the reformulation of foods to reduce salt content (for more details,&nbsp;see ""I–Improve&nbsp;nutritional quality of the whole food supply""). Prior to publishing the first set of targets&nbsp;providing guidance to the food industry on the levels of salt that they should be aiming to achieve, the&nbsp;FSA ran a four-phase salt campaign to raise awareness of salt consumption and to inform consumers how to lower salt intake.&nbsp;

The first phase (launched in September 2004) focused on educating the population on why too much salt is a health concern. The second phase (launched in October 2005) encouraged consumers to check food labels for salt content and to consume no more than 6g of salt per day. The messaging of the third phase (launched in March 2007) focused on the high salt content of everyday food and the need to choose low-salt products. The fourth phase (launched in October 2009) contained all the messages of the previous three phases. The campaign focused on women aged 35–65 because they are mainly responsible for buying and preparing food in family households. The FSA used its website, TV advertising, posters and printed material, articles in women’s journals and national newspapers as well as news coverage, in addition to leveraging stakeholders of the food industry and civil society organisations to get the message across to hard-to-reach groups.

The campaign was part of a larger salt reduction effort, which also included front-of-pack labelling and reformulation, and preceded salt reduction becoming part of the wider reduction and reformulation programme that Public&nbsp;Health England&nbsp;oversees. Advice including simple swap suggestions and low-salt recipes can also be found via Change4Life (for more details about Change4Life, see ""I–Inform people about food and nutrition through public awareness"").

The aim of the programme is to reduce people’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes across England.

The NHS DPP provides a behavioural intervention for individuals aged 18 years or over that are identified at high risk for progression to Type 2 diabetes. Individuals with blood glucose levels in the normal range (HbA1c less than 42 mmol or less than 6.0%) and those with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes are not eligible for the NHS DPP intervention.
Independent evaluation of the NHS DPP funded through the National Institute for Health Research shows the programme is effective in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Between 2016 and 2018 it reduced population incidence by 7% in areas where it was delivered, and people who completed the programme reduced their risk by 37%. The latest independent research published in February 2023 shows a 20% reduction in risk for those who are referred to the programme compared to those not.

– Health promoting diet – to cook and prepare healthy and safe meals that promote food enjoyment.

– Sustainable food habits and consumption – how use and choice of food affects the individual, the environment og the world we live in.

– Food and meals as a marker of identity and culture – how food culture changes and how that affects us, our world and our values. To meet across cultures enhances diversity and tolerance.


The Directorate of Education has collaborated with FAO and updated information on both guidelines for food and meals in schools and the food and health curricula in their School food global hub. There are two interdisciplinary topics that relate to food and health: health and life skills, and sustainable development. Core competencies are compulsory for these topics: for grades 1-7 (a total of 114 hours for all seven years) and for grades 8-10 (a total of 83 hours for all three years). Education on nutrition aspects is also embedded in other subjects such as science and general studies.&nbsp;
